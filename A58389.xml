            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>F I could be unea≈øy under any of your Commands, this, you may be a≈ø≈øured, would be the time of my ≈øhewing it: It is an hard task you have laid upon me; The Books, of which you require my thoughts, are long: and ≈øpeak the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor (whoever he is) to be a Man of great Learning and Rea≈øon; one, who can argue to the be≈øt advantage his Subject will bear. And the Collections he has made, plainly ≈øhew, that he has taken great pains, and bent all his thoughts for ≈øome time, to the maintenance of that Cau≈øe, to which ≈øome <hi>Prejudice</hi> has unhappily determined him. I, Sir, to your knowledg never ≈øaw the Books till within the≈øe very few days, and I fear you will have too much rea≈øon from what I write to believe me, when I tell you, That the reading the Books once over, (and that with frequent Interruptions too) wa≈øted almo≈øt half the time I have been able to allow my thoughts upon the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. This has prevented my con≈øulting any Books writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:29442:3"/> in favour of Submi≈ø≈øion to a King in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, nay, of reading Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi>'s Book, which the <hi>Defence</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to An≈øwer. You mu≈øt not therefore be ≈øuprized, if you happen to meet here with what others have ≈øaid on the ≈øame Subject, without any acknowledgment that I received it from them; or (which I more fear) if you ≈øhould find Opinions differing from tho≈øe of very great Men, who have undertaken this Controver≈øy. They were <hi>my Thoughts,</hi> Sir, which you required, and I have taken a cour≈øe to give <hi>them</hi> to you free, neither bia≈ø≈øed, nor over-ruled by the Opinions or Authority of others.</p>
            <p>The Que≈øtion, as 'tis ≈øtated by the Author of <hi>the Ca≈øe,</hi> is put very <hi>cautiou≈øly</hi> and ≈øtrongly in favour of the Cau≈øe he propo≈øes to him≈øelf to maintain; he has fenced it in with ≈øuch Re≈øtrictions in the ≈øtating, and the Expo≈øition of the Terms, that it would be a very unnece≈ø≈øary thing to undertake an An≈øwer to him, if his Book did not offer at the proof of more than the fir≈øt Que≈øtion under his Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitations, does require from him.</p>
            <p>No one, I ≈øuppo≈øe, who has ≈øubmitted to Their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øties Government, who thinks it too the <hi>Duty</hi> of all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh</hi> Men to do the ≈øame, and to pay Faith and Allegiance to them, will therefore believe him≈øelf at all concerned to maintain that, <hi>If a Per≈øon who has no manner of Right, by force, exclude, or depo≈øe a King, who≈øe Right to the Crown is clear and undoubted, and thereby gets the Exerci≈øe of the Government into his hands, the Regal Authority, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted Right remaining ≈øtill in the excluded Prince, the People ought to pay a full and entire Submi≈ø≈øion and Obedience to this King in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, ≈øo as never to attempt any thing again≈øt him, but ≈øtand by and defend him again≈øt the di≈øpo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øed Prince, with his Life and Fortune.</hi> This is a Ca≈øe of our Author's own making, and bears no Re≈øemblance
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:29442:3"/> to the pre≈øent State of this Nation: Nay, on the contrary, if I may take the liberty to reduce the general Que≈øtion to our particular Ca≈øe, I think the two things agreed by him, as Preliminaries, will ≈øufficiently ju≈øtify any <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Man in his ≈øwearing Allegiance, and paying the Duty <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ca≈øe,</hi> f. 2.</note> of a Subject to Their pre≈øent Maje≈øties. For the fir≈øt of them agrees, <hi>That a bare Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, tho purely by <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will carry a Right to the Subjects Allegiance in an He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary Monarchy, where the whole Royal Line is extinct; to prevent the Blood≈øhed and Confu≈øion which might follow upon the Peoples attempting to ≈øet up another Per≈øon or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> This prudential Rea≈øon, and a Submi≈ø≈øion upon it, he lays down to be a ≈øufficient Title to the U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and that it makes him <hi>from thenceforth King de Jure,</hi> one to whom all Faith and Allegiance becomes due. ('Tis ≈øo obvious of it ≈øelf, that I might ≈øpare the ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, That he frames his Ca≈øe upon a Suppo≈øition of the whole Royal Lines being extinct, for no other purpo≈øe than to re≈øtrain it ≈øo, as to extend only to Ca≈øes where there is no other Per≈øon in being, who has a ju≈øt Title to the Crown, and who≈øe Right is invaded by that Po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øion).</p>
            <p>The ≈øecond agrees, <hi>That where there are divers preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and it is not</hi> clear <hi>who has the true Right or Title; the Subjects Allegiance is to follow the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If therefore the late King, <hi>by</hi> the a≈ø≈øuming to him≈øelf an Authority to ≈øu≈øpend, and by general and unlimited Di≈øpen≈øations to repeal Laws without Parliament; <hi>by</hi> the entru≈øting almo≈øt the whole Power, Military and Civil, in the hands of ≈øuch Per≈øons only as would undertake with their endeavours to ≈øupport him in tho≈øe Exce≈ø≈øes; <hi>By</hi> the putting tho≈øe few Laws which he found it his intere≈øt to ob≈øerve, in Execution, by ≈øuch generally, as were by Law made incapable of all Tru≈øt and Rule; <hi>By</hi> the con≈øtant
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:29442:4"/> aim and tendency that every one of his Actions had to en≈ølave us at home, not to omit the Bonds prepared for us, by his immoveable Adherence to the Intere≈øts of the <hi>French</hi> King, from which (as a chargeable Experience teaches us) the utmo≈øt effort we can make, and that a≈ø≈øi≈øted with very great and powerful Alliances, will ≈øcarce re≈øcue us. <hi>If</hi> his unwearied endeavours to de≈øtroy the Reformed Religion, with a thou≈øand other Male-Admini≈øtrations, that ≈øtruck at the very Being and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of the Con≈øtitution it ≈øelf, and the Laws and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of <hi>the People of England;</hi> did declare, that he would not govern by our Laws or Act by an Authority limited by them. <hi>If</hi> upon the Parliaments humble and mode≈øt Repre≈øentation to him (according to their Duty) of the unwarrantablene≈øs of ≈øuch Proceedings, and the Alarm that the People took at his great Violations of their Rights, and Breaches upon the Government, he broke them up in Anger, and thereby ≈øhewed an ob≈øtinate and ≈øetled Re≈øolution to a≈ø≈øert that unlimited Power to him≈øelf, and govern according to it. <hi>If</hi> having by the≈øe Arbitrary Proceedings drawn great Difficulties upon him≈øelf, in≈øtead of taking proper Cour≈øes to ≈øecure his People again≈øt ≈øuch Exce≈ø≈øes for the future, he held to the ≈øame Coun≈øels ≈øtill, and by their Advice quitted the Kingdom, then in the utmo≈øt Confu≈øion, without making any Provi≈øion for the Admini≈øtration of the Government, and <hi>voluntarily</hi> put him≈øelf into the hands of its avowed perpetual Enemy. <hi>If</hi> all the≈øe things put together, will amount, either to a renouncing and di≈øclaiming his Title to a Government limited by Laws, or a di≈øabling and rendring him incapable to Exerci≈øe any Government at all. Nay, <hi>If</hi> the ≈øhare and intere≈øt which the Body of the People have in the Pre≈øervation of the Laws and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution, and their concern in the welfare of the whole,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:29442:4"/> will make it come up but to a doubtful Ca≈øe. <hi>If</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this, to re≈øcue us from tho≈øe Confu≈øions, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve what remained of the Ancient Government, and to re≈øtore what had been impaired, the Repre≈øenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the People did fill the de≈øerted Throne by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming the Authors of our Deliverance, King and Queen, and the Body of the People (for the number of Male-contents is ≈øo incon≈øiderable, that there is no need of ≈øoftning the word upon their account) have owned their Title to the Crown, ≈øubmitted and ≈øworn Allegiance to them as their Governors: And <hi>if</hi> it be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible to the whole World, that their Government has produced all the good Effects that were propo≈øed or aimed at, and they are in as full and quiet Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne, as ever any Princes were who ≈øat upon it, with a repeated Recognition of their Title. I cannot but think, that every one, who will give him≈øelf leave calmly to con≈øider, mu≈øt agree, That our Ca≈øe comes up to that which our Author puts. It does not, cannot appear that any other Per≈øon has a better Right to the Crown: and the con≈øequence of our Author's drawing from that, will be, That every <hi>Engli≈øh-man</hi> ought to bear Faith, and pay Allegiance to Their Maje≈øties, who (thanks be to God) are in ≈øo full a Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne.</p>
            <p>But not to enter farther into the general Que≈øtion, which, I think, ought not to be too freely ≈øearcht into, le≈øt it give Advantage and Encouragement to a ≈øort of People, who will be forward out of Wantonne≈øs, to put things in practice, which nothing but the utmo≈øt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity can ju≈øtifie; I conceive I ≈øhall effectually an≈øwer all that can be materially objected from <hi>the Ca≈øe of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>the Defence of it,</hi> again≈øt our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent Settlement, if I can maintain this Propo≈øition<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:29442:5"/> That <hi>where a King is in the full and quiet po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne, and Exerci≈øe of the Government; has been ≈øolemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly proclaimed, and freely and voluntarily recognized and ≈øubmitted unto by the States of the Kingdom as their King; has vi≈øibly the Power and Strength of the Nation in his hands; the Laws have their due cour≈øe in his Name, and all pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick ju≈øtice is admini≈øtred by tho≈øe deputed and commi≈ø≈øion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by him; altho he had no precedent legal Right, and that there is another per≈øon living, who according to the ordinary cour≈øe of Hereditary Succe≈ø≈øion, has a ju≈øt claim to the Crown; yet the Laws of</hi> England <hi>do require every private ≈øubject to pay their Allegiance to ≈øuch a King in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, and protect them in their ≈øo doing.</hi> And this, I hope, will be fully made out, by plain Law, and all the ≈øeeming Objections offered again≈øt it from the Laws of the Land, an≈øwered.</p>
            <p>To ≈øave my ≈øelf and the Reader ≈øome trouble here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, it will be convenient, before I enter into the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular con≈øideration of our Author's Arguments and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, to ob≈øerve, That the Government of <hi>England</hi> is to be con≈øidered in two re≈øpects: <hi>1≈øt,</hi> With regard to the Power of Legi≈ølature, <hi>viz.</hi> The King and Body of the States, who have power over all po≈øitive Laws, to make new ones according as they in their Judgments ≈øhall think expedient, and to alter, amend, and ≈øupply the defects of the old ones, as they in prudence ≈øhall judg the pre≈øent circum≈øtances of Affairs require. <hi>2ly,</hi> The Executive Power, of which the King is ≈øupreme, and Courts of Ju≈øtice, and other Officers ≈øubordinate under him. To them it belongs not to deliberate or determine, what in their opinions it were fit or rea≈øonable the Law ≈øhould be, and thereupon declare that to be Law; but to declare what the Law is, as it at pre≈øent ≈øtands, in every ca≈øe coming judicially before them, and to put that
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:29442:5"/> Law in Execution. This is ≈øo very obvious, that it mu≈øt without he≈øitation be agreed to me; and ≈øo mu≈øt the con≈øequence that I draw from it: That I need not make it any part of the pre≈øent Que≈øtion, Whether the Acts of one who is called an U≈øurper in Title, that tend immediately to the de≈øtruction of the right of the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed Prince, be ju≈øt in them≈øelves, ≈øo that they ought to continue in force, and not be repealed and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled, by a Power competent for that purpo≈øe, upon the injured Prince's happening to be re≈øtored to his Right: But whether ≈øuch Acts being done according to the known legal Forms and Ceremonies, by ≈øuch a Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor of the Throne as I have before de≈øcribed, eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry private ≈øubject may not, in good Con≈øcience, ≈øubmit unto and obey them, without taking upon him to judge of his Governour's Title? Nay further, whether the Laws of the Land do not protect him in ≈øo doing; and not only ≈øo, but require it from him?</p>
            <p>I think the Affirmative is agreeable to the Laws: And I now come to con≈øider what our Author ≈øays to the contrary.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt Point he endeavours to make out, is, That notwith≈øtanding the Opinions of the Eminent Lawyers whom he mentions (which I mu≈øt ob≈øerve were deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the times of Kings, who≈øe Titles to the Crown were undoubted, ≈øo that there was no nece≈ø≈øity for their ≈øtraining the ≈øen≈øe of the Law to make it favour their Ma≈øter's intere≈øt: and which, for ought that ever yet has appeared, were never contradicted hitherto by any one of that profe≈ø≈øion), <hi>A King de facto is not Seignior le Roy within the Statute of</hi> 25 E. 3.</p>
            <p>I ≈øhall through this Di≈øcour≈øe take tho≈øe words to mean, one who is in the full and peaceable po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne, and Exerci≈øe of the Government, with
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:29442:6"/> the free ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion of the People, by their Repre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives a≈ø≈øembled in a Parliamentary way; but wants a Title by proximity of Blood and Hereditary Succe≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and undertake for the defence of the duty of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to ≈øuch an one only, and not to any po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion without a true Right, ≈øhort of that: If any of the proofs which I ≈øhall make u≈øe of hereafter, ≈øhall carry it fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they will more ≈øtrongly prove this: But I will not an≈øwer for more.</p>
            <p>I ob≈øerve in general upon this Statute, 1. That the puni≈øhment pre≈øcribed by it, for the offences now under debate, is the utmo≈øt to which a temporal Law can reach, <hi>Death and Di≈øgrace:</hi> This will make it highly rea≈øonable, that the offence ≈øhould be plain and certain. And in the ≈øecond place, That this Statute was made in favour of the Subject, that he might be at a certainty what hazards he runs, and not be ≈øwallowed up in the Gulf, before he apprehended him≈øelf to be beyond his Banks: It made no new offence, but was re≈øtrictive of the liberty that Judges had taken before, of expounding every thing, that an angry or jealous Prince did re≈øent as a wound of his Maje≈øty, into High Trea≈øon. This is ≈øo well known to all that have lookt into the Law, that it were idle to quote Authorities for it. I will, add in the third place, as a thing not improper to be ob≈øerved, That it would be a very hard thing before <hi>E.</hi> 3's time to prove a certain Hereditary Succe≈ø≈øion. The be≈øt Hi≈øtorian will find but few In≈øtances of that kind from the Conque≈øt till the time of the making of this Statute. So that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of Hereditary Title, could not be a thing forgotten, or ≈ølipt over, as out of the minds of King or People: Yet I can't perceive any thing in this Statute, to lead to ≈øuch a di≈øtinction as is now made; tho it was made as a Rule for the Subject, from which he might learn, how
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:29442:6"/> he might demean him≈øelf in tho≈øe great matters with ≈øafety<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> There is not ≈øo much as an Hint, that the trying who has the ju≈øt Right and Title to the Crown, whether He, who is owned by the States of the Kingdom, and has the full Government and admini≈øtration of all Affairs; or another, who a thoughtful bu≈øie man (that can't con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent him≈øelf in the private ≈øtation wherein God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty has placed him, but mu≈øt <hi>make him≈øelf</hi> a Judge of the highe≈øt matters) will be fancying ought to be there. I ≈øay, That the trying that Point, ≈øhould be left to a Jury of 12 men; as it mu≈øt be, ≈øhould a private per≈øon be proceeded again≈øt for an attempt upon the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor, in order to the re≈øtoring the di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed Prince; If it be true, that it is not Trea≈øon by that Law, for a private Subject to attempt any thing again≈øt the King in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, in behalf of him, that of Right, by Hereditary Succe≈ø≈øion, ought to be King.</p>
            <p>This would be an hard Interpretation of a Statute, made in the time of a King who obtained po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Kingdom by a War levied again≈øt his Father, and a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Re≈øignation, after the Arms, of tho≈øe who took part with him, were ≈øucce≈øsful: In which taking up Arms a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt the King in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, notwith≈øtanding all that might ju≈øtifie it in Rea≈øon of State and Prudence, he was ≈øen≈øible that the Laws of the Land would not bear his friends out; and therefore thought fit, in the fir≈øt year of his Reign, to have an Act of Parliament pa≈ø≈øed, to indemnifie them again≈øt ordinary legal proceedings; for what they had done. This he lookt upon as nece≈ø≈øary, tho at the ≈øame time, he thought the Cau≈øe in which tho≈øe who fell in the War, died, ≈øo ju≈øt in it ≈øelf, that he made a new Law on purpo≈øe, to ≈øave them from ≈øuffering in their E≈øtates: For we find, in the ≈øame year, there was a Statute made, to entitle the Executors of tho≈øe, who
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:29442:7"/> were Slain in his Quarrel, in the pur≈øuit again≈øt his Father, to Actions to recover their Te≈øtators Goods.</p>
            <p>Lawyers account <hi>Co-temporaneam Expo≈øitionem,</hi> the be≈øt interpreter of the Sen≈øe of Statute-laws. I would fain have the Author, or any one el≈øe, who would confine the words <hi>Seignior le Roy</hi> in that Statute, to, <hi>Lawful and Rightful King by Hereditary Succe≈ø≈øion only,</hi> to ≈øhew any thing leading to that Interpretation in the Hi≈øtory of that time, or any of the Kings Reigns before that. Where it was ever heard of before that Act, that Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance was due to the uncrowned, un≈øubmitted-unto Right Heir? Nay, I will go farther, Where in any pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Record, before that Statute, there does appear a damning of the Title of ≈øuch a King, after a Submi≈ø≈øion of the People to him, in favour of him that was nearer in Blood? Whether the ≈øeveral Predece≈ø≈øors of <hi>E.</hi> 3. who had not a legal Title by Hereditary Succe≈ø≈øion, are not called Kings, in the Statutes of almo≈øt every year of his Reign, and all their Acts unque≈øtioned? If there were nothing extant to direct the Subjects to the contrary, and the King him≈øelf ≈øo often told them, that tho≈øe, whom <hi>I</hi> mu≈øt call Kings <hi>de Facto</hi> only, were Kings without any addition (the very letter of this Statute) it would in≈øtead of being an Ea≈øe and Relief to the People, have proved according to the pre≈øent Interpretation, the greate≈øt Snare that was po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible.</p>
            <p>'Twas ea≈øy for them to ≈øee and know who exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øed the Kingly Office, under who≈øe Admini≈øtration they had the benefit of the Laws, and by who≈øe Authority all Judicial Proceedings took their Cour≈øe. They might too, without any great difficulty, learn who were the vi≈øible Attendants on the Throne, the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:29442:7"/> King's near Relations, his Wife, Son, and Daughter. The Throne is but one, and they ≈øaw who po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed that. The name <hi>King,</hi> is a name of Office, which con≈øi≈øts in Exerci≈øe, that too was as plain to them. The words of the Statute ≈øeem as plain, <hi>'Tis Trea≈øon to compa≈øs or ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine the Death,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>of the King:</hi> Would it not now be a very great hard≈øhip to put it upon a private Per≈øon, to ≈øeek an hidden Sen≈øe in plain Words, and at the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of his Life and Family, to make him≈øelf judge of all the Difficulties which may ari≈øe upon our Con≈øtitution, (which, what it is in all points, never was or will be agreed upon)? Whether this Per≈øon that is ≈øo expre≈øly within the words of the Statute, may not hereafter appear to have been wrongfully po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed: And upon that apprehen≈øion, to put the poor Man under an Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of laying him≈øelf, for the ≈øake of a Nation, open to the Vengeance of one, who has the plain words of the Law on his ≈øide, and Power to back it? To put him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a nece≈ø≈øity of being a Sacrifice to his own private Opinion, again≈øt the publick acknowledgement of the Body of the People, in a ca≈øe wherein common Sen≈øe, and the Wi≈ødom of all Governments forbid the admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a private Per≈øon to be a Judge; nay, won't en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure its being made the Subject of a nice and curious Inquiry?</p>
            <p>But I perceive by <hi>Defence</hi> f. 6, 7. That it is one main ground of our Author's Opinion, and whereon he prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally relies, That the Law does not look upon the King <hi>de Facto</hi> to be <hi>King,</hi> but accounts him that is di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed, and <hi>de Jure</hi> ought to be ≈øo, to be ≈øo; and he calls upon Dr. <hi>Sherlock</hi> for Authorities to prove the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. This explains the two fir≈øt Lines of his Book, where he makes it the de≈øcription of a King <hi>de Jure,</hi> That he is <hi>the Per≈øon that has the Regal Authority.</hi> The Doctor
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:29442:8"/> had a≈ø≈øerted, That the King <hi>de Facto</hi> was King, as a ≈øelf-evident Propo≈øition; and I ≈øhould think my ≈øelf very ≈øafe in my Propo≈øition ≈øtill, were I in the Doctor's ca≈øe, without any other proof. But <hi>I</hi> will for once comply with the Author's Reque≈øt, and refer him to a very ingenious Book, called, <hi>The Ca≈øe of Allegiance to a King in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion,</hi> where he may find a great many unan≈øwerable Authorities to that purpo≈øe; e'en as many as ever there were Revocations, or Repeals of the Acts of ≈øuch Kings. There they declare, That the <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper</hi> was in fact King, but not in right; and after they have done ≈øo, unle≈øs there can be two Kings, they have left no other ≈øen≈øe for the words, <hi>King de Jure,</hi> but that of right he ought to have been King all that time, tho the other in fact was ≈øo. For his full ≈øatisfaction, I will give him a ta≈øte of one, out of many, and it ≈øhall be his <hi>Darling</hi> Act, the Statute 1 <hi>E.</hi> 4. which may be ≈øeen printed in the Record of <hi>Baggot</hi>'s Ca≈øe, in the Year-book, 9 <hi>E.</hi> 4, 9, 10. The Author quotes it often, and once as an Authority for him in this point, becau≈øe (≈øpeaking Hi≈øtorically, and de≈øcribing Per≈øons accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ≈øeries of times, that it ≈øpeaks of them in) it calls <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>Henry</hi> late Earl of <hi>Darby,</hi> as he was, when he <hi>reared the War again≈øt</hi> R. 2. which is the thing that follows that Name: But let us ≈øee what other ill things it ≈øays of him, Why, <hi>He u≈øurped and intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Royal Power, E≈øtate, Dignity, Preheminence, Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, and Lord≈øhip of</hi> England. And after he had done ≈øo, and King <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. was dead, it is true, <hi>By Law, Cu≈øtom, and Con≈øcience, the Right and Title of the ≈øaid Crown and Lord≈øhip, de≈øcended to the Earl of</hi> March. But then (as if it were afraid the ≈øen≈øe of the words, <hi>Right and Title,</hi> ≈øhould be mi≈øtaken) it ≈øets them in the next Sentence, in a direct Oppo≈øition to
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:29442:8"/> the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne in the Sen≈øe I contend for; where it ≈øays, That <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>according to the Right and Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the ≈øaid Crown and Lord≈øhip, after the decea≈øe of the Duke of</hi> York <hi>his Father, took upon him to u≈øe his Right and Title to the ≈øaid Realm, and enter'd into the Exerci≈øe of the Royal E≈øtate, Dignity, Preheminence, and Power of the ≈øame Crown, and to the Reign and Governance of the ≈øaid Realm of</hi> England, <hi>and Lord≈øhip. And amoved</hi> H. 6. <hi>from the Occupation, <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpation, Intru≈øion, Reign, and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernance of the ≈øaid Realm, to the great Joy of the Subject for their being departed from the Obey≈øance and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of the unrighteous <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper,</hi> &amp;c. If this be not enough, take the words more plainly, where the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute tells us, <hi>The Crown after the death of</hi> Rich. 2. ≈øhould <hi>have de≈øcended to the Earl of</hi> March, <hi>as next Heir of the Blood, if the ≈øaid <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpation had not been committed.</hi> The effect of the≈øe words is again repeated with regard to <hi>E.</hi> the <hi>4th</hi>'s Title. And the Statute expre≈øly di≈øtingui≈øhes, <hi>That the King was in right from the death of his Father, very ju≈øt King of the ≈øame Realm, but only from the fourth day of</hi> March, <hi>in lawful Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the ≈øame Realm, with the Royal Power, Preheminence, E≈øtate, and Dignity belonging to the Crown thereof;</hi> with abundance more to the ≈øame purpo≈øe. The≈øe Authorities, without remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on them, will probably go a great way in proof of the Doctor's Propo≈øition; and the rather, becau≈øe they are of times when <hi>de Jure</hi> was triumphant; if they don't ≈øatisfy, upon a little Intimation, more ≈øhall be given.</p>
            <p>I confe≈øs, I can ≈øcarce with Patience hear ≈øome Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions that are fondly broached upon ≈øo weak a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation as a private Judgment; ≈øo very dangerous to all Governments, and de≈øtructive to the Per≈øons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves who advance them. If the Con≈øtitution of the
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:29442:9"/> Kingdom were plain and po≈øitive, ≈øo that it were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øible for any unbia≈ø≈øed, con≈øidering Man, to think otherwi≈øe, but that our Monarchy is ≈øo <hi>unalterably</hi> Hereditary, that neither the Con≈øent, or other Act, nor any manife≈øt impediment or defect of the Per≈øon, who is next in Blood, could according to our Con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deve≈øt him of his Right to the Crown, or di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Subject from Obedience to him; Then, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, a private Man, who≈øe certain knowledg of the Royal Pedegree convinced him where the undoubted Right was, might rea≈øonably think him≈øelf bound in Ju≈øtice and Con≈øcience to pur≈øue that Title with his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, however Un≈øucce≈øsful, Violence, and Inju≈øtice might for ≈øome time render the Undertaking. But ≈øince it mu≈øt be agreed, That the Hereditary Right to the Crown by our Con≈øtitution, was never lookt upon to be ≈øo ≈øacred and inviolable, but that the next in Cour≈øe may have ≈øuch a known unfitne≈øs and incapacity upon him, of an≈øwering any of the ends of Government, that he may, without any Violation of that Con≈øtitution, be laid a≈øide: (As ≈øuppo≈øe him, to in≈øtance in one that all Mankind agree in, a perfect Ideot from his Nativity) And that one, who was once po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the Crown, may deve≈øt him≈øelf of his Right of Government, by a voluntary Quitting, or Re≈øignation of it; which may be done without making the whole Nation witne≈ø≈øes to it. So that it mu≈øt be allowed, that there may be in≈øtances wherein proximity of Blood in the right Line, will not be an infallible Badge of a Right to govern; and there may be great doubts who has the be≈øt Title. And ≈øince in the Ca≈øe of an ab≈øolute Incapacity to Rule, and in differences and competition between Titles, there mu≈øt be ≈øome Judge. And ≈øince <hi>Rea≈øon</hi> and <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øage</hi> ≈øay, That things of that nature, ought not to be of any pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate

If tho≈øe who argue ≈øo warmly again≈øt them≈øelves, and every private Subject of <hi>England</hi> in this matter, would but con≈øider what is ≈øaid before, that the 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. was made in favour of the Subject, to ≈øhew him his danger before he fell into it, and that it was not at all the end of that Law, to ≈øettle the Right of the Crown, (which our Author agrees is done by the Fundamental Con≈øtitution, and not any po≈øitive written Law) but only to ≈øecure the Peace and Quiet of the Kingdom from the attempts of private Per≈øons again≈øt their Governors, That the de≈øcription the Law generally gives of Trea≈øon, is, that 'tis <hi>Crimen Lae≈øae Maje≈øtatis,</hi> which ≈øeems to refer principally to the Office, and the Per≈øon as inve≈øtd with that, not to a di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed, tho rightful Heir, who is forced into a private Condition, and has little of that Maje≈øty to be guarded: And that in <hi>Glanvill</hi>'s time, the Peace and Settlement of the Kingdom was ≈øo much con≈øidered, that it was called Trea≈øon, <hi>Machinari Sedition<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

            <p>When the Author convincingly proves, That the next of the Royal Line in cour≈øe of de≈øcent, has as inherent and in≈øeperable a Right to the Allegiance of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:29442:10"/> as God Almighty has to the Wor≈øhip and Service of his Creatures; and that <hi>an Idol in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion,</hi> as he words it, by virtue of its being ≈øet up in a Temple, is po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of God's Power, and God Almighty deve≈øted of all Rule, (not to run the Parallel farther for fear of Bla≈øphemy) then I will grant he has offered a good Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument to prove that the word <hi>King</hi> in this Statute <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Cae≈øe,</hi> f. 7. <hi>Defen.</hi> f. 4.</note> can <hi>only</hi> ≈øignify the <hi>Right Heir,</hi> by the ≈øame Rea≈øon that the word <hi>God</hi> in the third Commandment can mean none but the <hi>True God.</hi> The Being of God is in its Nature unchangeable, his Name, and Right to govern us incommunicable. The Office of a King, and the Right of particular Per≈øons to that Office, are of politick In≈øtitution, and may be ≈øepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated.

            <p>So if the Author will make the Prie≈øthood ≈øuch an Office, as, that a Man's exerci≈øing the Functions of it will make him really and in truth a Prie≈øt, without entring in at the door (which my Profe≈ø≈øion does not lead me to the Interpretation of; but I ≈øuppo≈øe the Author mu≈øt think, ≈øignifies ≈øome ≈øetting apart, by tho≈øe with whom Chri≈øt has left ≈øuch a Power) then his Text may bear ≈øome Re≈øemblance to an Intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der into an Office, of which all ≈øides agree Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion <note place="margin">

            <p>I could have wi≈øhed, that our Author had con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a little better, before he had made the≈øe and ≈øome <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Def.</hi> f. 69.</note> other Compari≈øons.</p>
            <p>Our Author will make me weary of putting him in mind what the end of the Statute 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. was; if
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:29442:11"/> he had weighed that well, he would have found, That notwith≈øtanding what is offered by him, from the word <hi>Heir,</hi> again≈øt the Interpretation, my <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Ca≈øe</hi> f. 7. <hi>Def.</hi> f. 8.</note> Lord <hi>Coke</hi> was not ≈øo much in the wrong, when he ≈øaid, That <hi>our Lord the King,</hi> meant him that <hi>is King.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have already ≈øaid, That that Statute does not offer any thing towards the Determination of the Title to the Crown; who ought to be King, whether he that is in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, or another who pretends he has a ju≈øt Claim to it, is not its bu≈øine≈øs. There is, notwith≈øtanding what our Author ≈øays to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, another proper place for the deciding ≈øuch a Controver≈øy. But the Law declared by this Statute, ≈øecures the Throne again≈øt the Attempts of private Subjects, and binds them to a quiet Submi≈ø≈øion to the Office and Power, which is ≈øacred, in who≈øe hands ≈øoever it is And therefore (taking our Monarchy to be an Hereditary one, as it undoubtedly is) I can ≈øee nothing <hi>unrea≈øonable,</hi> much le≈øs <hi>contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctious</hi> in the affirming, That the Elde≈øt Son of a King <hi>de Facto,</hi> that is, one owned and ≈øubmitted unto by the People as their King, is Heir apparent to the Crown, and ought to be looked upon as ≈øuch, by every private Subject, until the Rightful Owner regain the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, or obtain the Sentence of tho≈øe, to whom the Right of determining it belongs, in his favour.</p>
            <p>Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, without any precedent Title, is a good Title again≈øt all the World, but him that has the true Right; ≈øo that, as between the U≈øurper and any private Per≈øon, the U≈øurper has a Right to the Throne, which is by the Con≈øtitution an Hereditary one. The Author him≈øelf will grant this, unle≈øs ≈øuch
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:29442:11"/> private per≈øon act in behalf of him, whom he ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øes to have the very Right; but of that Right, I cannot by any means allow the private Subject a Judge.</p>
            <p>I will readily agree, That this Statute did not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend any kindne≈øs to the U≈øurper, or the e≈øtabli≈øhment of his Title: nay, that the principal aim and de≈øign of the Law (of which that Statute was declaratory) was to pre≈øerve the Government, by ≈øecuring the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the King, (a Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion and Right then going to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether) and taking care of the Succe≈ø≈øion. And it has taken a much more effectual way to do it, then our Author's Interpretation, if that were admitted, would do. Let us turn our Author's Expo≈øition into expre≈øs words, and the Law will run thus, <hi>It ≈øhall be High Trea≈øon to compa≈øs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>the Death of the Lawful and Rightful King,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>But if there be one in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne, who is not Lawful and Rightful King, then it ≈øhall be no fault for any particular Subject to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pa≈øs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>his Death, in order to the in≈øtating him that has Right, in the Throne.</hi> Would ever any King, be his Title never ≈øo undoubted, think him≈øelf advantaged or ≈øecured by ≈øuch a Provi≈øion, where, by expre≈øs words of a Law, liberty would be given to every par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Subject, to examine and pa≈øs Sentence on his Right? Is it not a more rea≈øonable and prudent Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øion, and more likely, even to prevent an U≈øurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in after times, to guard by expre≈øs Law his Per≈øon, (who was at the time of the making the Law rightful Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor) and that of him, who of Right ought to ≈øuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed him, and ≈øo downwards for ever under the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>e≈øt Penalties. And (taking it for granted, that that Provi≈øion would keep the Right and Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) to require the Obedience of every particular
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:29442:12"/> Subject to the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor from time to time, without al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Rabble a liberty of examining into the Title.</p>
            <p>So that it is very far from being an unrea≈øonable Expo≈øition of the Law, tho it ≈øhould happen to be a Protection to the Wife and Son of an U≈øurper in Title, to ≈øay the Title of the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor of the Crown ≈øhall not be canva≈ø≈øed by every Subject, but the Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Office ≈øhall ≈øet him above any particular per≈øons pa≈ø≈øing <hi>Sentence</hi> on, and exerci≈øing <hi>Authority</hi> over him.</p>
            <p>In ≈øhort, The Common-Law, which made ≈øuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Provi≈øion for the ≈øecurity of the Per≈øons of the King and his Relations, could not do it for any Sanctity of their Per≈øons, any otherwi≈øe, than as they were inve≈øted with the Kingly Office, and in relation to that. It ≈øecured them for their own ≈øakes, but more for the ≈øake of the Government, and to pre≈øerve the Peace and Order of that. It ≈øuppo≈øed indeed, that no Per≈øon would obtain <hi>it,</hi> but he who had a Right, becau≈øe no other ought to do ≈øo; and all the Subjects are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged under the greate≈øt ties to prevent it; But 'twas as far from the Intention of the Law, as it is from Sen≈øe and Rea≈øon, to leave it at the liberty, nay, make it the duty of every particular per≈øon to rai≈øe Di≈øturbances, and throw an whole Kingdom into Confu≈øion; becau≈øe he, again≈øt the Recognition and Sen≈øe of the Body of the People, thinks another's Title to the Crown better than his who wears it. So, (to carry this on) as again≈øt the People who have no Right at all to the Crown, for the pre≈øerving and continuing the Hereditary Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, it provided for and ≈øecured the Son of the King in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, as the Per≈øon who according to our Con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, has pre≈øumptively a Right to ≈øucceed his Father
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:29442:12"/> in the Throne, till there be ≈øome Authoritative Decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration again≈øt his Father's Title. I confe≈øs, <hi>Heir Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent to a King</hi> de facto, <hi>who has no Title to the Crown, but his own Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion,</hi> as the Author has tacked the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Def.</hi> f. 9.</note> words together, does ≈øeem odd; but the difficulty is in the words only, not in the thing. The name King is never clogged with the≈øe words <hi>de Facto,</hi> till he is out of Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion: The private Subject mu≈øt look upon him as his King, and con≈øequently on his Son, as the Heir of his King, and ≈øo not attempt any thing again≈øt them, which is what the Laws again≈øt Trea≈øon provide for. The <hi>de Facto,</hi> which is all that imports any incon≈øi≈øten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy or Contradiction, does not then belong to him.</p>
            <p>But we are told, <hi>That the con≈øtant Practice and Cu≈øtom</hi> 
               <note place="margin">

               <hi>of the Realm, is ≈øo far from warranting my Lord</hi> Coke<hi>'s Glo≈øs, that it proves the contrary. For that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon every Revolution, u≈øed to Attaint the Adherents to tho≈øe who oppo≈øed them, tho acting under a King in Po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øion; nay, dealt with the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor him≈øelf as a Traytor, ≈øcarce allowed him the Name of a King, or lookt upon his Acts of Government as Valid and Authoritative in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I lay all the≈øe together, becau≈øe the ≈øame An≈øwer will in a great mea≈øure ≈øerve for all of them, tho each may have its particular con≈øideration.</p>
            <p>None of tho≈øe Proceedings amount to ≈øo much as a colourable Proof, That to act again≈øt one, who in Ju≈øtice, and according to our Con≈øtitution ought to be King, but is out of Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion; in Obedience unto, and Defence of the King who is publickly ≈øubmitted unto by the Body of the Kingdom, and in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Government, is by any Law, at pre≈øent a Law of the Land, Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.

            <p>The People either of them≈øelves to make Court to the Power then uppermo≈øt, or being over-awed by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tere≈øt and Recommendation of tho≈øe about the King, did generally elect and return the Friends and Adherents of the prevailing Party, who≈øe Wounds being fre≈øh, and their Lo≈ø≈øes quick and piercing, they kept them≈øelves within no bounds of Ju≈øtice or Moderation: They were re≈øolved to gratify their private Re≈øentments, and revenge them≈øelves for Injuries done them or their Friends upon any terms; ≈øo that they took not either the Laws of the Land, or the common Rules of Ju≈øtice, for their guide, but made both truckle to their Pa≈ø≈øions. The King was glad to le≈ø≈øen the number of his Enemies, the cutting off many of whom, and frightning the re≈øt into Submi≈ø≈øion by ≈øuch Examples of his Severity, he lookt upon as the only means to ≈øecure him≈øelf again≈øt another turn. That this was the Ca≈øe, is certain, and I wi≈øh we could find in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances in our Ancient Hi≈øtories <hi>only,</hi> in the times of our <hi>Edward</hi>'s and <hi>Henry</hi>'s, to prove, that where there are two conte≈øting Parties in a Kingdom, neither of them will make u≈øe of the advantages they happen to obtain over the other, with ≈øuch a temper as right Rea≈øon and Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence would direct. But the violence of ≈øuch Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings mu≈øt not be offered as any proof or mea≈øure of Right; nay, they are unfit to be mentioned, or made u≈øe of in any cool debate, unle≈øs it be to create in the
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:29442:13"/> minds of Men, an abhorrence of ≈øuch Actings, and by ≈øetting forth the calamitous Con≈øequences that were pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the puni≈øhing the poor Subject, upon the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Succe≈ø≈øes on cach ≈øide, to recommend that wi≈øe and equal Law, which not only declared, That the Subject <note place="margin">11 <hi>H.</hi> 7.</note> ought to be indemnified in his paying his Service to the King for the time being, for that it was his <hi>Duty</hi> to do ≈øo; but provided, That all Statutes made afterwards to the contrary, ≈øhould be void. This latter part was all of the Statute which was new, the re≈øidue was always Law, and is there only authoritatively declared to be ≈øo. And that part of it that was new, can't have its full effect to re≈øtrain ≈øub≈øequent Parliaments, to which no po≈øitive Laws can give bounds. But yet their aiming at ≈øuch a Re≈øtraint, is a ≈øufficient Caution to future Parliaments, to con≈øider very well before they make any Law contrary to it; which is thereby adjudged a thing utterly unfit to be done, and that in the mo≈øt ≈øolemn manner, by as wi≈øe a Prince as ever filled the Throne; and a People, who≈øe Sufferings under the mi≈øchiefs of a contrary Practice had convinced them, not only of the rea≈øonablene≈øs, but the ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity of the thing.</p>
            <p>I think, I need not ≈øay any thing farther as to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances out of Hi≈øtory, during the Wars between <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Lanca≈øter:</hi> If there were need, the Author has done it to my hand, <hi>Ca≈øe</hi> f. 11. and el≈øewhere; at lea≈øt, as to any Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Right or Ju≈øtice that can be drawn from the Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance they dealt to each other upon any Advantages. <hi>E.</hi> 4. attainted <hi>H.</hi> 6. and all his Adherents, being an U≈øurper upon his Rights, and gave very hard words to him, as well as to his Grand-father <hi>H.</hi> 4. the fir≈øt Inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Right of the Hou≈øe of <hi>York;</hi> and <hi>H.</hi> 6. his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing actually a King in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion was not a Protection again≈øt it. Will it thence follow, that by the ≈øtanding
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:29442:14"/> Law of <hi>England,</hi> a King in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion not being rightful Heir to the Crown, and all tho≈øe that act under him, are Traytors and Rebels to the di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed Prince? Will not <hi>H.</hi> 6th returning his Complement to the full, when he was re≈øtored to the Crown, as effectually prove the Law to be with him being in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, tho <hi>E.</hi> 4. had the better Title. In truth, none of the≈øe In≈øtances prove any thing, but that <hi>de Facto</hi> and <hi>de Jure</hi> were much alike e≈øteemed, when they got the Power into their hands; they made their Parliaments ≈øay, and do what they plea≈øed, when either of them had ≈øufficient Power to put the Acts made again≈øt his Rival, and tho≈øe who adhered to him, in Execution.</p>
            <p>I can't forbear ob≈øerving, That in all the≈øe <hi>violent</hi> times, there is not ≈øo much as one In≈øtance of any Per≈øon adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a Traytor for his ≈øerving the King in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, upon an Indictment in the ordinary cour≈øe of proceedings accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the e≈øtabli≈øht Laws. All tho≈øe Determinations pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from the Parliament, <hi>ex plenitudine pote≈øtatis.</hi> And 'tis plain, that they did not ≈øo much as pretend to ≈øquare their Actions to the Laws then in being, by the In≈øtance he gives, where <hi>H.</hi> 6. is attainted of High Trea≈øon for <note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>Not to mention that the Author agrees, the D. of <hi>York</hi>

               <hi>Ed.</hi> 4. to the <hi>pretended Parliament</hi> 49 <hi>H.</hi> 6. be≈øides what has been ob≈øerved in general before, I will add only, that the Right and Ju≈øtice of his Cau≈øe depended upon the Nullity of their Proceedings; and yet he dur≈øt not in≈øi≈øt upon the Original Nullity of them, which (it may be ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed he knew) 'twas not the part of private Men or the Judges to determine: And therefore it was done by a Law; and that Law is an Act of Repeal only, <hi>Rever≈øing, revoking,</hi> and <hi>making,</hi> not <hi>declaring</hi> the former proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings void.</p>
            <p>Nor is there any thing in what we find <hi>Ca≈øe. f.</hi> 14. that can amount to a Proof of his Po≈øition. In the end of that Page he grants that Acts of Parliament pa≈ø≈øed under an U≈øurper are valid without any Confirmation: If he had not, we have a better Authority for it, That of the ≈øelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øame Parliament that gave the Determination in favour of the <hi>D. of Tork</hi>'s Title to the Crown: <hi>That the Laws took no place again≈øt that.</hi> And they that were ≈øo bold to do that, would not have been afraid to have carried it on further, if Law or Rea≈øon would have ≈øuffered them. Yet they, and the <hi>D. of York</hi> him≈øelf, ≈øolemnly declare, <hi>That all the other Acts and Ordinances made in the <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper's Parliament, be good and ≈øufficient.</hi> (Now if it be e≈ø≈øential to every Act of Parliament, that the King's Approbation give it life, ≈øurely the Law mu≈øt look upon tho≈øe Per≈øons to have been <hi>Seigniors les Roys,</hi> who≈øe Laws are unque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtionably allowed to be good.) Nay, it appears mo≈øt plainly that the Statute of 1 <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 1. for confirmation of Judicial proceedings, which our Author in≈øi≈øts on, was <note place="margin">Ca≈øe. <hi>f.</hi> 14.

            <p>Both the≈øe will receive one An≈øwer.

This I am ≈øure will be agreed unto me, If there be any ≈øuch Judicature, it can be none but they: And allowing them to be ≈øo, common ≈øen≈øe will ≈øay, They being made Judges, mu≈øt thereby <hi>impliedly</hi> have a Right to act in it, free from all precedent Obligations of Duty to either Party; They act as freely in that point, till the Determination is made, as their Ance≈øtors did, when they may be ≈øuppo≈øed to be met together, to agree upon a Form of Government; Only that they are to keep to the Rule, which they find ≈øetled and agreed on both ≈øides, <hi>viz.</hi> That our Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is an Hereditary Monarchy; And the Que≈øtion to be determined by them is, Which of the Pretenders has the be≈øt Title upon that Foundation. Is it not then an Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front put upon the judgment of a Reader, to ≈øay, That, becau≈øe it is maintained, that the po≈øitive Laws of the Land, for the Quiet and Pre≈øervation of the Monarchy, forbid every private Subject, in his capacity of a Subject, to take upon him to cen≈øure the Title of a King po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the Throne, it will thence follow, That the States or Body of the Nation, when there is ≈øuch a ≈øtop in the proceedings, by ≈øome doubt upon the very Con≈øtitution it ≈øelf, that the whole is likely to fall, unle≈øs a deci≈øion be made of it; ≈øhall not have an equal Power to re≈øcue them≈øelves from that Confu≈øion, as their Ance≈øtors had to form them≈øelves into Order.</p>
            <p>They do this upon the Rea≈øon of the Con≈øtitution it ≈øelf, and by a Power and Fundamental Right, which of nece≈ø≈øity mu≈øt be ≈øuppo≈øed to be re≈øerved, when they em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodied them≈øelves into a Politick frame: they act in it upon their old Natural Liberty, which could never be ≈øubmitted to the Prince in this in≈øtance, becau≈øe the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion ari≈øes only upon the doubt, who is the Prince.</p>
            <pb n="28" facs="tcp:29442:16"/>
            <p> And therefore the Duke of <hi>Tork,</hi> in his An≈øwer to the Objection, that was made again≈øt his Claim to the Crown from the Oaths they had taken to <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. tells the Lords, <hi>He lawfully may claim and pur≈øue his right, and demand Ju≈øtice in ≈øuch form as he doth: And that all other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, and namely the Peers and Lords of this Realm may, and by Law of God and Man ought, to help and a≈ø≈øi≈øt him in Truth and Ju≈øtice, notwith≈øtanding tho≈øe Oaths,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Our Author calls for a proof, of the Authority of the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament <note place="margin">Def. <hi>f.</hi> 34.</note> or States of the Kingdom, to determine the Rights of conte≈øting Princes: As if there were a printed In≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Fundamental Con≈øtitution extant, by which the Priviledges and Powers of each part of it are limited. 'Tis ≈øaid before, that nece≈ø≈øity of Government warrants this; and the ≈øame nece≈ø≈øity warrants their convening in order to it, without the formality of a Summons. That Form and Method of proceeding ≈øuppo≈øes a King and Government ≈øetled, and is one of the Rules which direct the King how he ≈øhall admini≈øter that Government, and what are the Duties and Offices of particular per≈øons un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it: This is above all tho≈øe Forms; a nece≈ø≈øary Means to ≈øettle the Rule it ≈øelf.</p>
            <p>However, I am pretty confident that tho≈øe conver≈øant in our ancient Hi≈øtories, and Parliamentary Records, will find rea≈øon, to carry the Power of the States of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom farther, rather than to deny their Authority in this point. The Claim of the D. of <hi>York</hi> 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6. is not the only in≈øtance of the thing; but it being a very ≈øolemn and notorious one, and a full proof of this point, I will lay it down a little more fully and in a piece, then it was for our Authors turn to do.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Richard</hi> Duke of <hi>York</hi> 39 <hi>H.</hi> 6. comes to the Parliament, and <hi>by his Coun≈øel,</hi> puts in his Claim in Writing, to the Crown; deriving his Pedigree very plainly, ≈øo as to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>title him≈øelf as next Heir by a Lineal Succe≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <pb n="29" facs="tcp:29442:16"/>
            <p> The Pedigree could not be unknown, to any one of the Lords, before whom the claim was laid; yet King <hi>H.</hi> 6. having long enjoyed the Crown, the Lords ≈øay, <hi>The mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was ≈øo high, and of ≈øuch weight, that it was not to any of the Subjects to enter into Communication thereof, without his high Commandment, Agreement and Con≈øent had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto.</hi> They thereupon go to the King opening the Claim; He could not be put into a better condition then he was; and therefore, had he lookt upon this cautiou≈øne≈øs of the Lords to be more than Complement, he would never have con≈øented to their hearing it; but he does not offer to forbid their proceeding; tho 'tis certain he was ≈øen≈øible of the defects of his Title, and therefore earne≈øtly prays the Lords to examine ≈øtrictly, and rai≈øe all the Objections they could again≈øt the Duke's Title.</p>
            <p>Then they read the Claim, and order the Judges to ≈øay what they could in maintenance of the King's Right. They excu≈øe them≈øelves, ≈øay, <hi>It hath not been accu≈øtomed to call the Ju≈øtices to Coun≈øel in ≈øuch matters; the matter was too high, and toucht the King's High E≈øtate and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galie, which is above the Law, and pa≈ø≈øed their Learning; wherefore they dur≈øt not enter into any Communication there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, for it pertained to the Lords of the King's Blood and the apparage of this Land, to have Communication and meddle in ≈øuch matters.</hi> But this was not the only rea≈øon the Judges gave for their ≈øilence; They ≈øay, <hi>They were the King's Ju≈øtices, and have to determine ≈øuch matters as come before them in the Law; between party and party they may not be of Coun≈øel: And this matter was between the King and the ≈øaid Duke of</hi> York <hi>as two parties.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Judges Excu≈øe was allowed as proper, for, Coun≈øel was not their Duty; 'twas not a matter to be adjudged by the expre≈øs Laws of the Land, of which they had the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition and Execution; but by ≈øomething above the po≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Laws; And, they were not a part of the Parliament,
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:29442:17"/> that Power of determining they had none. But the King's Attorney and other Coun≈øel being required to do what had been required of the Judges, the like Excu≈øe would not be admitted from them, <hi>for they were the King's par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Coun≈øellers, and therefore they had their Fees and Wages:</hi> They return, <hi>They were the King's Coun≈øellers in the Law, in ≈øuch things as were under his Authority, or by Commi≈ø≈øion; but this matter was above his authority, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they might not meddle:</hi> Yet they are over-ruled, for 'twas their Duty to offer what they could in a Court of Judicature in defence of their Ma≈øter's Title. Then <hi>It was agreed by all the Lords, that every Lord ≈øhould have his freedom to ≈øay what he could ≈øay, without any reporting or magre to be had for his trying.</hi> And <hi>after the ≈øaying of all the Lords, every after other,</hi> Objections are framed again≈øt the Duke's claim. The Duke puts in An≈øwers to them, and often prays that the matter might be determined. The Lords ≈øolemnly declare that the Duke's Title could not be <hi>defeated,</hi> but agree upon the Expedient which the Chancellor propo≈øes, <hi>de≈øiring the Lords, that if any of them could find any other or better means, that it might be ≈øhewed; whereupon after ≈øad and ripe Communication in this matter had, it was concluded and agreed by all the ≈øaid Lords, that ≈øith is was ≈øo, that the Title of the ≈øaid Duke of</hi> York <hi>cannot be defeated, and in e≈øchewing the great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience that might en≈øue, to take the means above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hear≈øed</hi> (viz. <hi>That the King ≈øhould keep the Crowns, and his E≈øtate and Dignity Royal, during his life, and the ≈øaid Duke, and his Heirs, to ≈øucceed him in the ≈øame.)</hi> The Lords open this Expedient to the King, and both the Parties ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly ≈øubmit and agree to it.</p>
            <p>From this proceeding 'tis very plain in the fir≈øt place (which I toucht upon before) That if the Judges who made the Excu≈øe, and Lords who admitted it, know any thing of our Con≈øtitution, they are to judge according to
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:29442:17"/> the known and written po≈øitive Laws of the Land, which pre≈øcribe the Offices and Duties of particular per≈øons, and to ≈øpeak what their ≈øen≈øe is; but have nothing to do with enquiring into, or giving their Judgment upon the King's Title: They are to put the Laws in Execution under the King: But they can't find any Law to condemn or med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with the Title of the King in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, no nor to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it, (being called in que≈øtion in a proper place.) The Laws with which they were intru≈øted, meddle not with it the one way or the other; And they declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves incompetent to give any Advice or Determination in it; tho our Author will make every particular man a competent Judge of it.</p>
            <p>And 'tis as plain in the next place, That all the Parties agree the Parliament to be proper Determiners of ≈øuch a difference, (which may inform our Author, who after e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting a Court in every private man's brea≈øt to do it, can't find in our Con≈øtitution any Court for that purpo≈øe.) Nay <note place="margin">Ca≈øe. <hi>f.</hi> 66.</note> the Judges tell you, The King and the Duke are before them <hi>as party and party:</hi> That is, Two per≈øons, conte≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a proper Court, for a Judicial Determination.</p>
            <p>The Lords think ≈øo too; They oblige the King's Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øel to appear before them, and defend their Maje≈øties Right, as a part of the Service that they owe the King, <hi>for their Fees and Wages:</hi> The Duke often pre≈ø≈øes them for their Judgment, and at la≈øt they give it.</p>
            <p>In the third place, I ob≈øerve that this Expedient is of the Lords own finding out, and they decree it. 'Tis true, in the Chancellors repeating the Opinion of the Lords, there are the words, <hi>If he would,</hi> upon which great ≈øtre≈øs is often laid, not only by our Author, but others; and more then the thing will ju≈øtly bear: The Chancellor ≈øays, <hi>That it was thought by all the Lords that the Title of the ≈øaid Duke cannot be defeated:</hi> That is, That none of tho≈øe things objected to it, had de≈øtroyed the Right of the
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:29442:18"/> Duke and his Line, for ever. <hi>And in e≈øchewing the great Inconvenience that may en≈øue, a mean was found to ≈øave the King's Honour and E≈øtate, and to appea≈øe the ≈øaid Duke if he would,</hi> &amp;c (which imports no more, then that the mean they agreed upon, would be to his ≈øatisfaction, if he would be contented with rea≈øonable terms) This, I ≈øay, is only the repetition of the Chancellor of the re≈øult of the Lords Debate: But when they come to the Judgment, that is general; That the ≈øaid mean ≈øhall be taken; and this given, before any Declaration of the Con≈øent either of the Duke or King to it; tho afterwards, upon its being opened to them, it was with great ≈øolemnity agreed unto by them, and pa≈ø≈øed by the King into an Act of Parliament.</p>
            <p>The very Statute of 1 <hi>E.</hi> 4. allows this Judgment to be good; and that, by virtue of it, and the Agreement upon it, <hi>H.</hi> 6. ≈øhould. have held the Crown for his life, tho the very Right were with the D. of <hi>York:</hi> But it being part of the Agreement that the Lords ≈øhould ≈øupport it, <hi>and keep, ob≈øerve and ≈øtrengthen, ina≈ømuch as appertaineth to them, all the ≈øaid things, and re≈øi≈øt to their power, all them that will pre≈øume the contrary, according to their E≈øtates and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. E.</hi> 4. gets a ≈øolemn Declaration by that Statute, that <hi>H.</hi> 6. had attempted the breaking the Agreement, and therefore his di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing him was ju≈øt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> He thought it advi≈øable, that the breach of the particular Agreement a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Crown, as well as the Title it ≈øelf, ≈øhould be decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and ≈øetled by Parliament: And indeed the very na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of all Acts of Recognition, and the con≈øtant u≈øage of them in almo≈øt every Reign, ≈øhew the Expediency of ≈øome publick Declaration to the People, that they may know to whom their Obedience is due; and imply as much as the Preamble of the Stat. 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. ≈øpeaks in expre≈øs words, which Preamble our Author quotes, becau≈øe it affirms the Title of an U≈øurper; (He was an U≈øurper, but one who made as good and wi≈øe Laws, as any lawful King his Predece≈ø≈øor)
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:29442:18"/> 
               <hi>That the mo≈øt part of the People can't be ≈øufficiently learned in the Laws and Cu≈øtoms which make out a Right and Title to the Crown: And that the Court of Parliament is of ≈øuch Authority, and the People of the Land of ≈øuch a Nature and Di≈øpo≈øition, that Manife≈øtation or Declaration of any Truth made by the three E≈øtates of the Realm a≈ø≈øembled in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by Authority of the ≈øame, makes, before all things mo≈øt faithful and certain quieting of men's minds, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moves the occa≈øions of Doubts and ≈øeditious Language.</hi> This is Truth and Rea≈øon out of who≈øe mouth ≈øoever it comes, or for whatever End it was pronounced; and in all Ju≈øtice ought to protect every private Per≈øon in his ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion to a Power acknowledged in that manner, again≈øt all the Di≈øturbers of the quiet of our pre≈øent Settlement.</p>
            <p>I come now to con≈øider the Ob≈øervations he makes upon the Authorities quoted by my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> to ju≈øtifie the glo≈øs made upon the words <hi>Seigneour le Roy</hi> in the 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. The fir≈øt is <hi>Baggot</hi>'s Ca≈øe. To ≈øtate this matter fairly, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears on the Book, the Ca≈øe in ≈øhort is this. <hi>Baggot</hi> brings an A≈ø≈øize of his Office, <hi>&amp;c. Ivie</hi> the Tenant pleads, <hi>Baggot</hi> was an Alien, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and ≈øo could not hold the Office, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not being the King's Liege Subject. <hi>Baggot</hi> replies, his <note place="margin">9 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 7. <hi>b.</hi> 9 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 9.</note> Letters of <hi>Naturalization.

               <hi>Coke.</hi> After hearing what was urged on both ≈øides, the
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:29442:19"/> Ju≈øtices ≈øay, <hi>They had conferred with the Judges of the Common-Pleas upon all the Points objected, And they all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed, That none of the Objections had any thing in them to arre≈øt the Judgment,</hi> and therefore <hi>Baggot</hi> recovered<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> The only Reflections I will at pre≈øent make upon this Ca≈øe is, That altho, what is referred unto by my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> might be, Originally, the Argument of <hi>Baggot</hi>'s Coun≈øel only, yet ≈øurely in a Point of ≈øuch Con≈øequence as this, the Judges would not have let the≈øe matters pa≈øs without ≈øome Check or Cen≈øure, if they had not approved them: They would not have given Judgment on the ≈øide of tho≈øe who argued in that manner, without di≈øtingui≈øhing what they did agree unto, and what was not to be allowed of, if any part of what they had laid down, had not been agreeable to the Law and their Opinions. As Affairs then ≈øtood, there was much greater danger, that the Judges, who owed their Offices to the Power in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, would le≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øen and vilifie the Acts of the ca≈øt-off, di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed Prince; and that the Coun≈øel would be afraid of ≈øpeaking up to the full, what their Cau≈øe would bear; Then that extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant things ≈øhould be a≈ø≈øerted at the Bar, and not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pa≈øs unreproved from the Bench, but have the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of a Re≈øolution of the Court on their ≈øide; and that a very ≈øolemn one, upon Advice with the other Judges; which mu≈øt be ≈øingly upon that point, and not any of the others, they not being worth the lea≈øt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate or hae≈øitation.</p>
            <p>I think this were ≈øufficient, but I will add this further Ob≈øervation; That there never has been in any Times ≈øince, (the Times of mo≈øt undoubtedly rightful Kings) any contradiction to this Opinion, or ≈øo much as a Quaere put upon it. <hi>Brook</hi> in the Abridging of it, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends it with a <hi>Nota,</hi> as a thing worth ob≈øerving. <hi>Coke, Hales,</hi> and <hi>Bridgman</hi> in Print declare this to be Law: Our Author is the fir≈øt <hi>hardy</hi> Man that has un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:29442:19"/> to ≈øet him≈øelf again≈øt ≈øo generally a received Opinion: He has taken pains in it I confe≈øs; but that he has not ≈øo throughly weighed it, as he ought, appears by the An≈øwer he gives to that part, quoted to prove, That a Pardon granted by a King out of Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion is <note place="margin">Ca≈øe. <hi>f</hi> 24.</note> void: If he had read the words over carefully, he would have found they amount to thus much in <hi>Engli≈øh: If</hi> 
               <note place="margin">9 <hi>E</hi> 4. 2.</note> 
               <hi>he that is now King, in the time of</hi> Henry VI. <hi>had made a Charter of Pardon, it would be void even</hi> Now; <hi>for every one who grants a Pardon mu≈øt be King in Fact.</hi> The≈øe words won't admit of the Eva≈øion of its being void <hi>in Effect only, and in its Operation,</hi> not from a want of Authority to grant it, but of Strength to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force and ≈øupport it. The only Judge that ≈øpeaks pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly (for they were tickli≈øh Times, and they thought fit to act very cautiou≈øly for fear of giving Offence) was <hi>Billing.</hi> What he ≈øays, plainly proves, what our Author el≈øewhere will not admit, That the Office of King and the Royalty it ≈øelf is in the King <hi>de facto,</hi> while he is in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion. This <hi>Billing</hi>'s words, as quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by our Author, prove: There he gives a Rea≈øon <note place="margin">Ca≈øe. <hi>f.</hi> 16.</note> why the Legitimation by <hi>H.</hi> 6. ≈øhould be good, <hi>viz. That 'tis an Act of Grace, and it belongs to every King by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of his Office</hi> (of which Office he took <hi>H.</hi> 6. to be po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed) <hi>to do Acts of Ju≈øtice and Grace:</hi> His other ca≈øe of Exemptions, put in the ≈øame place, proves as <note place="margin">9 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Br. Exemp.</hi> 4.</note> much: For if he were not po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the Royalty it ≈øelf, he could not make any Grant to the Subject, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Intere≈øt to bind his Succe≈ø≈øor, or of Ea≈øe to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge the Subject in the time of a ≈øucceeding Prince, from what the Law ≈øubjects or obliges him unto.</p>
            <p>But our Author has found an In≈øtance, wherein it was <note place="margin">Def. <hi>f.</hi> 41.</note> held, that Grants of a King <hi>de facto</hi> to the Prejudice of a King <hi>de jure,</hi> are not valid: If I ≈øhould tell him, that after the rightful Heir (at lea≈øt he that pretended to be
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:29442:20"/> ≈øo, and to avoid his Grant upon that ground) had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to ≈øubmit to him as his King for his Life, he was not an U≈øurper upon him; then his Ca≈øe will prove too much. But the thing it ≈øelf is not to be wondred at, that a ≈øucceeding King ≈øhould <hi>find</hi> or <hi>make</hi> a Rea≈øon for the re≈øumption of Crown Lands. There are People abroad in the World that would have helpt <hi>Henry</hi> II. to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Revenues of the Crown are ≈øo far a Tru≈øt in them≈øelves, being given for the Support of the Government and Defence of the Kingdom, that they are not of Right alienable.</p>
            <p>But, to return to <hi>Baggot</hi>'s Ca≈øe, I agree, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil do not argue, or the Judges determine (as our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <note place="margin">Ca≈øe. <hi>f.</hi> 17.</note> ob≈øerves) from any Statute of this Realm: There was not any ≈øuch, nor any need of one. Common Law and common Rea≈øon ju≈øtified their Re≈øolution. And if the Rea≈øon of the Thing, and Nece≈ø≈øity of Government determined that ca≈øe to them, where there was not any thing el≈øe to Govern it: Had not that Man need have a great deal of Wit and Subtilty who undertakes to prove, That as plain words in an Act of Parliament as can be devi≈øed, having the ≈øame Rea≈øon and Nece≈ø≈øity to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force their being taken in their common and ordinary ≈øen≈øe, ought to be expounded away by the Judges into quite another thing, only to avoid their falling in with that rea≈øonable and convenient ≈øen≈øe.</p>
            <p>But this is not the only Book-ca≈øe before the Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 7. which Rules our Point in effect. When <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. had obtained an entire Victory, killed King <hi>Richard</hi> in the Field, and was Proclaimed King, he re≈øolved ≈øoon to call a Parliament: One of the ends of his doing it ≈øpeedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> ≈øays, was, <hi>To have the Attainders of</hi>

               <hi>all his Party (which were in no ≈ømall number) rever≈øed, and all Acts of Ho≈øtility, by them done in his Quarrel, remitted and di≈øcharged:</hi> And accordingly Acts were
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:29442:20"/> pa≈ø≈øed to that purpo≈øe. But before it was done, a Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtion in Law was moved. Divers of the mo≈øt con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable favourers of the King's Party, during the Reign of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, were attainted by Outlawries and otherwi≈øe for that cau≈øe: Or, as my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> expre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes it, <hi>His Partakers were attainted for Offences incident to his Service and Succour.</hi> Many of the≈øe were Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned Knights and Burge≈ø≈øes for the Parliament; the Judges are advi≈øed with upon it, who forthwith a≈ø≈øemble in the Exchequer-Chamber, and all agree, <hi>That the</hi>

            <p>But they went further, and unanimou≈øly Re≈øolved, That there was no manner of Nece≈ø≈øity to do any thing for the Rever≈øal of the King's Attainder (who was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainted too;) For that <hi>Eo facto, that he took upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf the Royal Dignity to be King, he was di≈øcharged of all Incapacities, and needed not any Act for the Rever≈øal of his Attainder.</hi> My Lord <hi>Bacon</hi>'s Remark upon this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolution is, That it was <hi>A grave and ≈øafe Opinion and Advice, mixed with Law and Convenience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, in this Re≈øolution, the Judges mu≈øt either take <hi>H.</hi> 7. to have a Right to the Crown, or that he had not, but was an U≈øurper. That they took the former for granted, is, I think, very plain: Or at lea≈øt they mu≈øt know, that the Lady <hi>Elizabeth</hi> (who≈øe Cau≈øe he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took, and with whom, <hi>by Pact precedent with the party who brought him in, he was to Marry)</hi> had ≈øo. If they did ≈øo, then they plainly determined that a Conviction of a Man under an U≈øurper, for High Trea≈øon, where the very Act of the Trea≈øon was, Adherence unto, and Attempts to recover the Rights of the di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed injured Prince, ≈øtill remains, even after the Rightful Prince has
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:29442:21"/> regained po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne; ≈øince all Incapacities continued upon tho≈øe <hi>Loyal</hi> Men, till their Convictions were Rever≈øed by Parliament; That is, till a <hi>new</hi> Law was made to help them: Till that was done, tho≈øe who had the Execution of the pre≈øent Laws only, could not ≈øay other than that the Offence whereof they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victed (which was an Attempt again≈øt the Prince then in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion) was High Trea≈øon; and they were ≈øtill obnoxious to the Puni≈øhments the Laws inflict on Tray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; although what they attempted was done to ≈øerve and ≈øupport the Intere≈øts of the Rightful Princes.</p>
            <p>If the Judges took <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. to be an U≈øurper, yet we gain this point by their ≈øecond Re≈øolution: They agree him to be inve≈øted with the Royal Authority by his <hi>A≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Crown,</hi> and the Submi≈ø≈øion of the People: By that, his Natural Per≈øon is changed, and ≈øo <hi>con≈øolidated with the Politick Capacity,</hi> Plow. Com. 238. <hi>b.</hi> that every Imperfection was purged, and all the Objections that lay either again≈øt his Per≈øon by <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. Attainder, or again≈øt his Title, which was for ever condemned by Act <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Temp. H.</hi> 6.</note> of Parliament, removed.</p>
            <p>And this Opinion of the Judges in <hi>Henry</hi> the Seventh's ca≈øe was not the fir≈øt In≈øtance of this kind, as appears by the Ca≈øe of <hi>Hen.</hi> 6. mentioned by <hi>Town≈øend,</hi> who after his Re≈øumption of the Crown held a Parliament, though <note place="margin">1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 5. <hi>b.

            </p>
            <p>Neither was the Notion of the Per≈øon being changed by the A≈ø≈øuming the Crown, new, or framed for that particular Ca≈øe: For we find that when <hi>Rich.</hi> 3. a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the Royal E≈øtate upon him≈øelf (and he was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly an U≈øurper) it was found nece≈ø≈øary to make a Statute in the fir≈øt Year of his Reign, That <hi>where he was enfeoffed joyntly with others to an <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øe, the other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feoffees</hi>

This Ca≈øe, I ≈øay, proves not only that <hi>it is Trea≈øon for a private per≈øon to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule the Title of the King that is in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion,</hi> which my Lord <hi>Bacon</hi> deduces from the words, but it makes it Trea≈øon to refu≈øe his Active Obedience for the Support of that King in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, even again≈øt him, who, he is ≈øatisfied, has a better Right. This I am ≈øure mu≈øt be the Opinion of tho≈øe who condemned him; and the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtorian in that place takes Notice that <hi>the Judges of that time were great and learned Men, and the three Chief of them of the Privy Council.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to ≈øhew how far the Law-givers of that time lookt upon private Subjects to be bound up by ≈øuch Acts of Government made in the time of an U≈øurper, as our Author would have called <hi>Inauthoritative, null, and void,</hi> until an equal Power have adnulled, or decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them to be ≈øo, I will refer my Author to the Year-Book, 1 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>f.</hi> 5. <hi>b.</hi> There he will find a ≈øpecial <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morandum</hi> of the Rever≈øal of an Act of Parliament, which Act was ≈øo fal≈øe and ≈øcandalous, that, upon Advice of the Ju≈øtices it was not thought fit to recite the Matter or

They it ≈øeems did not look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the private Judgment of the Clerk of the Parliament to be ≈øufficient to adjudge of our Author's <hi>Nullities in them≈øelves;</hi> though that private Judgment determined in favour of what they lookt upon to be the Right, joyned with the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion.</p>
            <p>I come now to con≈øider the Statute 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. <hi>c.</hi> 1. the Preamble of which declares, <hi>That the Subjects, by rea≈øon of their Duty of Allegiance, are bound to ≈øerve their Prince and Soveraign Lord for the time being, in his Wars, for the Defence of him and the Land, against every Rebellion, Power, and Might reared again≈øt him, and with him to enter into Service, if the Ca≈øe ≈øo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>And that whatever the Succe≈øs fall out to be, 'tis not rea≈øonable, but again≈øt all Laws, Rea≈øon, and good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, that they, ≈øo going with him in his Wars, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending his Per≈øon, or being el≈øewhere by his Command, ≈øhould lo≈øe or forfeit any thing, for doing their true Duty and Service of Allegiance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thereupon 'tis Enacted and E≈øtabli≈øhed by that Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>That no per≈øon from thenceforth, that attend upon the King and Soveraign Lord of this Land for the time being, in his per≈øon, or do him true and faithful Service of Allegiance, ≈øhall for that be vexed or troubled, either by Act of Parliament or otherwi≈øe.</hi>

            <p> Our Author by what has been already ≈øaid, will find the mi≈øtake that he is under, when he ≈øays the Lawyers agree, <hi>That it is this Statute only, which has extended</hi>

The end of that Statute 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. as I have ≈øaid before, was not ≈øo much to make a ≈øolemn Declaration of the Law (which all through it is taken for granted, as an indi≈øputable Opinion of that time at lea≈øt) as it was to condemn the way that had too often been lately taken, to de≈øtroy the good Effects of the Law in that particular; by making ≈øo many revengeful Acts of Attainder upon every change. They endeavoured, as far as the Nature of the thing would admit of it, to tie up, even the Hands of future Parliaments, from acting contrary to that ea≈øie and rea≈øonable Rule: And having done that, little thought they had left a Liberty to pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate Men to vent their Opinions and Fancies, rai≈øe Scruples in the minds of People, and write Books to prove that a King is no King, nor to be obeyed: And that a bare Right to be a King, (which ≈øuppo≈øes and imports in the very terms them≈øelves his being di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed of the Throne and Office) makes him, the Only Per≈øon meant by the words <hi>Seignior le Roy;</hi> whereas he that is in full po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Office and Government, is quite out of them.</p>
            <pb n="42" facs="tcp:29442:23"/>
            <p> But to ≈øhew our Author that the Notion was not quite new, and fir≈øt introduced by this Statute to ≈øerve a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular turn, nor the Opinion of Lawyers only, I would refer him to a Treati≈øe, Entituled, <hi>An Hi≈øtorical Account of ≈øome things relating to the Nature of the</hi> Engli≈øh <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment;</hi> there, <hi>f.</hi> 40.

            <p>Nay, for want of other Authorities, I would venture to make U≈øe once more of our Author's Act 1 <hi>Edw.</hi> 4. which not only very fully a≈ø≈øerts, <hi>That the <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpers were by their <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpation po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the Regal Power, E≈øtate, Dignity, Preheminence, Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, and Lord≈øhip of</hi> England, to which purpo≈øe it was quoted before, but goes on; <hi>By</hi> Edward <hi>the Fourth's removing</hi> Henry <hi>the Sixth from the Occupation, <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurpation, Intru≈øion, Reign, and Governance of the ≈øame Realm of</hi> England <hi>and Lord≈øhip, to the <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>niver≈øal Comfort and Con≈øolation of all his Subjects and Liege Men, plenteou≈øly joyed to be amoved and departed from the</hi> Obey≈øance <hi>and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>nrighteous <g ref="char:V">∆≤</g>≈øurper,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p> Neither can I yet work my ≈øelf up to think, That the Enacting a new Law, in a particular Ca≈øe, contrary to the purview of a precedent general one, is a total Repeal of that Law. As for in≈øtance: Suppo≈øe in the Ca≈øe of my Lord <hi>Strafford;</hi> Becau≈øe he was attainted by Act of Parliament, without Proof by two Witne≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, and for Facts, none of which, con≈øidered ≈øingly and by them≈øelves, amounted to High Trea≈øon, but made a great accumulative Crime, therefore, if it had not been for the Caution u≈øed, That the like ≈øhould ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be drawn into Precedent or Example, from that time forward, a load of le≈ø≈øer Crimes mu≈øt have grown up into one High Trea≈øon, and the Statutes of 25 <hi>Edw.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> had ≈øtood entirely Repealed in tho≈øe points: <hi>They,</hi> for ≈øo much, <hi>having in effect been declared to be null and</hi>

King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eight having indulged him≈øelf very greatly in the taking and di≈ømi≈ø≈øing of Wives, did from time to time, according to the run of his Affections, make ≈øeveral Laws for the Settlement of the Succe≈ø≈øion; and laid great Penalties on the Infringers of tho≈øe Laws, and particularly on ≈øuch Per≈øons as ≈øhould U≈øurp upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to whom, by the plain and expre≈øs words of the re≈øpective Acts, the Crown was limited and entailed: The≈øe Laws were very nece≈ø≈øary at that time, becau≈øe from the unu≈øual Liberty he had taken in that particular, of nece≈ø≈øity <hi>great ambiguities and doubts mu≈øt ari≈øe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ≈øeveral Titles, which might be pretended to the Crown, and thence would probably en≈øue great effu≈øion of Blood,</hi> &amp;c. as the Statutes 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>c.</hi> 22. &amp;c. ≈øpeak.</p>
            <p>To prevent this, he very prudently takes care to tell his Subjects, by Act of Parliament, where their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience ≈øhall be paid, names the Per≈øons in cour≈øe as they ≈øhould ≈øucceed; And forbids, under the greate≈øt Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, any <hi>One</hi> to U≈øurp upon or Claim a Title otherwi≈øe than according to tho≈øe Limitations. The≈øe Acts (≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øing that Acts of Parliament can alter the Hereditary Cour≈øe of De≈øcent, which <hi>perhaps</hi> my Author and ≈øome few others will not agree, but I can't bring my ≈øelf to make any doubt of) amount to no more than this: That any who ≈øhould offer to break through that Limitation, ≈øhould be U≈øurpers, and tho≈øe that ≈øhould aid and a≈ø≈øi≈øt them therein, be Traytors. I have not yet pretended that tho≈øe who aid and abett one that has no Title, and put him into the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne, are inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent; or that the Act of Exalting an U≈øurper to the Throne, is ju≈øtifiable: All that I contend for, is, Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:29442:26"/> to them after they are in quiet po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion: So that the≈øe Acts make nothing for what my Author in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to prove, or again≈øt what I propo≈øe to my ≈øelf to defend: They laid not any Obligation on Con≈øcience contrary to the Statute 11 <hi>Hen.</hi> 7. But provided only to ≈øecure the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion to tho≈øe mentioned in that Set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement, by making it Death for any to attempt, or a≈ø≈øi≈øt in the breaking of it. But I will for once ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, tho≈øe Acts had in expre≈øs words Enacted<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> That, if Per≈øons contrary to tho≈øe Limitations, did get into the Throne, and obtain a full Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of it, all tho≈øe who had been A≈ø≈øi≈øtant unto them in their ≈øo doing; Or who ≈øhould afterwards ≈øubmit to them, ≈øhould be pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhed as Traytors: Yet this would amount to no more, than that the general precedent Law, and the Obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it, was Su≈øpended and Repealed as to this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular In≈øtance; As if it had in expre≈øs terms ≈øaid, In the≈øe particulars, when the Right of Succe≈ø≈øion is ≈øo plainly determined to the Subject by a competent Power, that there is no po≈ø≈øibility of his being mi≈øtaken in it, unle≈øs he be ≈øo, <hi>wilfully:</hi> Whoever attempts any thing contrary to them, ≈øhall not have benefit of Indemnity from any former Laws, but the Per≈øon ≈øet up, and all his Adherents, and tho≈øe that ≈øupport him in his U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation, ≈øhall be puni≈øhed as Traytors. This would have been ≈øo far from a total Repeal, that it would rather have been a Confirmation of the precedent Laws in all other ca≈øes but tho≈øe particular In≈øtances.</p>
            <pb n="49" facs="tcp:29442:26"/>
            <p> The ≈øame is to be ≈øaid to the Oaths enjoyned by tho≈øe Laws of <hi>H.</hi> 8. for the e≈øtabli≈øhing the Succe≈ø≈øion: Suppo≈øing them to have laid an Obligation upon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience, contrary to the general Purvieu of the 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. for the time to which they extended, yet the matter of them is long ≈øince ceas'd: And I can't find any Rea≈øon or Authority to prove, that a contrary provi≈øion, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a fixed and determinate time, does, <hi>for ever,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal a general po≈øitive Law.</p>
            <p>The late Oaths of Obedience in Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> and King <hi>James</hi>'s times, have left the Title to the Crown, as general and un≈øettled as it was in the time of <hi>H.</hi> 7. So that the Subjects are now obliged by Vertue of tho≈øe Oaths to the true Succe≈ø≈øors in the Kingly Power; and I think what is already ≈øaid, makes it plain, that a private Subject mu≈øt look upon tho≈øe who are in full and quiet po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne, to be truly and lawfully ≈øo, till they are either deve≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Power, or their Right condemned by tho≈øe that have Authority to do it. The word <hi>Heirs,</hi> I own is joyned to <hi>Succe≈ø≈øors</hi> in the≈øe Oaths; but if either, as the Lawyers ≈øay, <hi>Haeres dicitur ab Haereditate,</hi> or the words of them≈øelves, being joynt, extend only to ≈øuch an Heir as is a Succe≈ø≈øor, (as I mu≈øt think, till I hear better Arguments to the contrary, then I ever yet have met with,) the≈øe Oaths will make for, not again≈øt me.</p>
            <p>However I can't find any contradiction between the≈øe Oaths and the Statute 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. They do not ≈øpeak <hi>Ad idem.</hi> 'Tis too gro≈øs to be put upon any Man at this time of day, to ≈øay, The≈øe Oaths oblige us to any certain Per≈øon under the name <hi>Heirs and Succe≈ø≈øors</hi> during the life of the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor; ≈øo that the end of the≈øe Oaths was to put an Obligation on Con≈øcience to prevent the Act of U≈øurpation, and pre≈øerve the
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:29442:27"/> Government Hereditary: The Act of <hi>H.</hi> 7. ≈øuppo≈øes that ≈øettled, and declares what a Subject is to do when it is ≈øo.</p>
            <p>Be≈øides I think the Lawyers generally agree it for a Rule, <hi>That it mu≈øt be a very plain Contrariety, and ab≈øolute Incon≈øi≈øtency, that ≈øhall effect a Repeal of a former by a ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequent Statute, without expre≈øs words of Repeal: And that a Law being once e≈øtabli≈øhed, with the univer≈øal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent of the whole Kingdom, it mu≈øt not be look'd upon to be abrogated by any ≈øtrained Con≈øtruction of general and ambiguous Words.</hi> And if this be true, I am ≈øure the Stat. 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. ≈øtands yet unrepealed by any of the Laws our Author has produc'd again≈øt it.</p>
            <p>I can't but wonder to hear a private per≈øon deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining, That a <hi>Statute,</hi> That is, a Law of the Land, <note place="margin">Ca≈øe <hi>f.</hi> 36. Defence <hi>f.</hi> 47.</note> mu≈øt be lookt upon as <hi>null and invalid, in re≈øpect of the matter of it,</hi> becau≈øe in his Opinion, <hi>It e≈øtabli≈øhes Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity,</hi> and is made, as he ≈øays, <hi>Ca≈øe</hi> f. 32. <hi>To the di≈øhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øon of a lawful King,</hi> That is, a King of the Laws making. In plain <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> this amounts to thus much; The Title which the King has to the Crown, tho it belongs not to him, either by the Law of God or Nature, but by a po≈øitive Law of the Land, can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be wholly defeated, or abridged in part, nor the Power or Rights of it moderated for a certain time, by as po≈øitive a Law: This is a very Paradox, and needs a man of our Author's Learning and indu≈øtry to make it look colourable.</p>
            <p>This and a great deal more of our Author's argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Ca≈øe</hi> f. 37, 38, 39, 40, 41. will fall to the ground, if he will, till he proves the contrary, admit, 1. That the word <hi>King</hi> does not nece≈ø≈øarily import in it ≈øelf, in all places, any certain and determinate Rights and Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges; but that the po≈øitive Laws of the Land are Bounds unto, and may pre≈øcribe the Order and Form of
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:29442:27"/> legal Ligeance, and may enlarge or abridge tho≈øe Rights which the name <hi>King,</hi> according to the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral extent and ≈øen≈øe of the Word would have enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled the Per≈øon unto. And <hi>2dly,</hi> if I could prevail upon him not to lay ≈øo much ≈øtre≈øs upon that Word, when 'tis joyned to <hi>de jure;</hi> not ≈øuppo≈øe him ≈øtill in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Office, but fairly Engli≈øh it, a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon who has Right to the Office and Government, but is wrongfully put out of it.</p>
            <p>The fallacy grounded upon the latter of the≈øe, runs through ≈øo many parts of the Book, that more than half his arguing part might have been ≈øaved, if he he would have ≈øtated it truly: If he would but agree to me, that the word <hi>King,</hi> is rather a name of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Office than per≈øonal Right, there would be an end of a great part of the Di≈øpute. Let us turn it into <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour</hi> and ≈øee how the Que≈øtion will then ≈øtand. <hi>VVhether in this Government, the Subjects are to pay their Service and Duty to him that is in Fact their Governour, tho he obtained the Government by unju≈øt means, or to him who ought to be their Governour, but plainly is not, nor has a Power to exerci≈øe any Acts of Government, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther over, or in defence of them.</hi> I am apt to think it would be an hard thing for a man of very great parts, ≈øo much as to amu≈øe any man, if he would ≈øtate the ca≈øe ≈øo; or to per≈øwade him, that the Duty of the per≈øon governed, has any relation to the Right of the per≈øon, di≈øtinct from the Office. In ≈øhort, That private man goes beyond his Line who looks upon him that is out of Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion to be his King, or acts accordingly, when the Throne is filled with a Po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øe≈ø≈øor qualified as I have before ≈øet down: And if ≈øo, the Statute 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. implies nothing of that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction which the <hi>Ca≈øe f.</hi> 53. fixes upon it.</p>
            <pb n="52" facs="tcp:29442:28"/>
            <p> I would not be mi≈øtaken in this, ≈øo as to have it objected to me, That I am coming within the reach of that <hi>mi≈øchievous Po≈øition</hi> of ≈øeparating the Per≈øon and Office: It was always my Opinion that the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it (as it has been formerly made u≈øe of) would be in con≈øequence very pernicious and is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Rules of Law. The mi≈øchief of that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition is, the di≈øtingui≈øhing between the Kings Acts and Capacities, while he is a King and in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion: to ≈øay ≈øome of his Acts are tho≈øe of his natural per≈øon, ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated from his politick Capacity, and upon that ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition to take a liberty of acting again≈øt his natural Per≈øon, as ≈øuppo≈øing that di≈øtinct from his politick Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity. This appears to be the Mi≈øchief, by what is quoted out of <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Ca≈øe; where 'tis ≈øaid, <hi>That Lige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance</hi> 
               <note place="margin">Defence <hi>f.</hi> 25.</note> 
               <hi>is due to the natural Per≈øon of the King, which is ever accompanied by the politick Capacity, and the politick Capacity as it were appropriated to the natural Capacity; and 'tis not due to the politick Capacity only, that is, to the Crown and Kingdom di≈øtinct from his natural Capacity.</hi> And by the Act of Uniformity, which declares it a Trayte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Po≈øition, <hi>to take Arms by the King's Authority a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt his Per≈øon:</hi> This ≈øhews, that the ill of the di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction condemned there, lies in the ≈øeparating the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities when they are really joyned; that is, when the natural Per≈øon is in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Kingly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice: to ≈øet him up to fight again≈øt him≈øelf, his own Authority again≈øt his Per≈øon; this is contrary to Law, which, as it appears before, <hi>con≈øolidates</hi> the natural Per≈øon with the politick Capacity. I am ≈øo far from denying this, that it is the ground whereupon I take Obedience to be due to a King <hi>de facto:</hi> But the mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous part does not at all reach our Ca≈øe, where we ≈øuppo≈øe him, who has a Right to be King, to be utterly di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed and deve≈øted of the Office, and
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:29442:28"/> the Right of the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor ≈øolemnly recognized by the Body of the People: There, 'tis not a nice di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction that ≈øeparates between the Capacities, but e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vident Fact and Truth, common Sen≈øe, and the Laws of the Land; and to the Per≈øon, as a Per≈øon deve≈øted of the Office, Allegiance is not due. That it was a very great wrong unju≈øtly to deve≈øt the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon of the Office, and put another into it, can't be doubted; and 'tis a part of that wrong, that he is thereby deve≈øted of that which makes the Relation between him and the People, that of right ought to be his Subjects, and pay him Allegiance; but till he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unite the Office to his Per≈øon, the wrong remains, and the Relation during that time fails.</p>
            <p>It may be very well maintained, that the Statute 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. ≈øhall have all the Effect and Operation the plain Words of it will rea≈øonably bear; and yet none of tho≈øe di≈ømal Breaches upon the Con≈øtitution, and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamitous Con≈øequences ≈øet forth, <hi>Ca≈øe</hi> f. 38. at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it.</p>
            <p>That the Fundamental Con≈øtitution of <hi>England</hi> is a Monarchy, and that ≈øettled antecedently to any Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute Law, will be very readily agreed to him by me: But he goes a little too fa≈øt when he infers thence, <hi>That therefore there mu≈øt of nece≈ø≈øity be ≈øome certain per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon in every Age, in whom the Con≈øtitution ve≈øts a Right; by vertue of which, he is lawful and rightful King of this Realm:</hi> For 'tis not of ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity that the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Race and Family ≈øhould be part of that Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental Con≈øtitution.</p>
            <p>May it not be rationally ≈øuppo≈øed that the Framers of our Government proceeded by degrees; fir≈øt, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated what the form of the Government in general ≈øhould be; and fixt upon a Monarchy: What kind of Monarchy would make another ≈øtep, and I will ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:29442:29"/> that, to prevent the ill effects of Ambition and canva≈øing for it, they agreed, it ≈øhould be an Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary one, ≈øuch as ≈øhould be governed by the cour≈øe of de≈øcent, not elective: This in common ≈øence it mu≈øt be pre≈øumed they did, before they came to fix upon certain Per≈øons or Families, into who≈øe hands they ≈øhould put the Government: Nay 'tis impo≈ø≈øible to maintain our Government to be a limited or mixt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy in its nature, without ≈øuch a ≈øuppo≈øition: ≈øo that I can't by any means look upon the particular Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily to be any part of the Original and Fundamental Con≈øtitution; but at mo≈øt, only a ≈øecondary one, a putting the Con≈øtitution that they had agreed upon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Act and Execution: And therefore it may very well be, for any thing that I can find in rea≈øon to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, That the Government may fall into the hands of per≈øons, that have no relation to the Line of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces fir≈øt ≈øubmitted unto, who ≈øhall yet have a Right by vertue of the Fundamental Con≈øtitution.</p>
            <p>Our Author has almo≈øt yielded me this in his fir≈øt <note place="margin">Ca≈øe f. 2.</note> Preliminary: But to vary that in≈øtance a little: Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe during the Life of him that ≈øhould happen to be the la≈øt of the Race of our Princes, He and his Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament ≈øhould agree, that after his death another Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon and his Race ≈øhould ≈øucceed to the Throne accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the directions and Mea≈øures pre≈øcribed by the pre≈øent Laws, would any body que≈øtion his right to ≈øucceed? The Fundamental Government would be ≈øtill the ≈øame; A mixt Monarchy according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent Con≈øtitution: And I cannot per≈øwade my ≈øelf that in the Con≈øtitution it ≈øelf, the intere≈øt of the particular Family was ≈øo highly regarded, as that the one mu≈øt nece≈ø≈øarily fall with the other. Our Author indeed I find thinks, that becau≈øe <hi>Hereditary</hi> is joyned to Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy, <note place="margin">Defence f. 12.</note> when once it falls to another Family, the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchy
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:29442:29"/> is gone. An E≈øtate in Fee-≈øimple has this Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, that it is an E≈øtate of Inheritance: That is, an <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary</hi> E≈øtate: If therefore the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øor transfer it to a Stranger, mu≈øt the E≈øtate be gone? ≈øuppo≈øe <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reditary</hi> ≈øhould be expounded in the one ca≈øe as well as the other, to ≈øignifie ≈øuch an E≈øtate as will of its own nature de≈øcend to Heirs, and ve≈øt in them a Title if the Di≈øcent, be not interrupted, by ≈øuch methods as the Law allows of: And be lookt upon, to be ≈øet in oppo≈øition to <hi>Elective</hi> in the one ca≈øe, and an E≈øtate <hi>determinable upon the death of the Party</hi> in the other.</p>
            <p>I confe≈øs I ≈øhould think it an exceeding of their Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, for a King and Parliament to turn this Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into a Common-wealth; for they act under the pre≈øent Frame and Con≈øtitution: Whenever that is di≈ø≈øolved, they have no longer a right to act as Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentatives of the People; ≈øo that they cannot, <hi>for them</hi> ≈øubmit to a new form of Government. To the doing any thing of that kind, there mu≈øt be fir≈øt a di≈ø≈øolution of the pre≈øent Frame, and then, either all mu≈øt joyn in the erecting a new one, or they mu≈øt, after they are rein≈øtated in the Liberty which they had by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, agree upon ≈øome method of being repre≈øented, and delegate their Right and Power to ≈øuch Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øentatives. This ≈øhews that this opinion does not offer at the warranting a ≈øubjection to any U≈øurper, but ≈øuch an one as is in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, under the form the pre≈øent Con≈øtitution allows. All others, not agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this Frame of Government, are in, <hi>above</hi> or <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øide</hi> the Law, and con≈øequently have not Right to <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> Allegiance, which is the re≈øult of the pre≈øent Con≈øtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of Laws made for the pre≈øervation of that. Such a Power may hold me in ≈øubjection as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Man or a Slave, and for the obtaining my Life or Freedom, I may anew ≈øtipulate with them;
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:29442:30"/> and from that time they may ju≈øtly claim my Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by vertue of that ≈øtipulation: I may ≈øtipulate a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new, I ≈øay, if my former allegiance ob≈øtruct it not: But that may very well fall out to be the ca≈øe, for till there is an entire di≈ø≈øolution of the Government (whether that mu≈øt be done by the agreement of all who have an intere≈øt in it, or that a majority will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the re≈øt) I own that Allegiance is due from every private Man ≈øome where; And I am ≈øure I may, without contradicting any thing I have hitherto ≈øaid, fix the right to it in the Per≈øon of the King <hi>de jure,</hi> where the Kingly Office is not exerci≈øed by any other: But where another is po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the very Kingly Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, which is wrought into the Con≈øtitution it ≈øelf, and he puts in execution all the ≈øame Laws by which rightful Kings ought to govern; to that Office, and the Per≈øon po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of it, my Allegiance is by tho≈øe Laws due, and no Law makes me a Judge of the King's Title.</p>
            <p>And it was upon this Ground undoubtedly that my Lord Chief Ju≈øtice <hi>Hales</hi> (who plainly held the Law in the <hi>Ca≈øe</hi> of the Statute 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. to be as I now main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain it) would never try any Trea≈øon or other Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces again≈øt the State, as our Author ≈øays, while he was <note place="margin">Ca≈øe, <hi>f.</hi> 4.</note> Judge under <hi>Cromwell.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to return: What if I ≈øhould ≈øuppo≈øe, (as ≈øome <hi>wi≈øe</hi> Men have affirmed) that when our Ance≈øtors heretofore ≈øubmitted to a certain Family, to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way occa≈øion of Factions and making Parties, they confined the Crown to that Family, but did not ≈øo ≈øtrictly oblige them≈øelves to him who ≈øhould be next in Cour≈øe of de≈øcent; but that the States of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, who repre≈øent and include the body of the whole People, if they found him ab≈øolutely unquali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and unfit for the Government, might skip over
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:29442:30"/> him, ≈øtill keeping to ≈øome of that Line. (And ≈øince what the Original Frame of our Con≈øtitution was, is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to us with any certainty, by Hi≈øtory or Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Records, that may well be ≈øuppo≈øed to be our Con≈øtitution, if con≈øtant Practice and U≈øage, till very lately, be a probable proof of Right in things where the po≈øitive Rule is lo≈øt.)

               <hi>of the Original Con≈øtitution,</hi> &amp;c. But not to rely upon this, I mu≈øt take leave to believe what I touch'd upon before, That it was the Form of the Government it ≈øelf, of which our Ance≈øtors, who fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it, were ≈øo fond, and not of the particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon or Family; tho they were by that Form to have the greate≈øt Tru≈øt and be≈øt Share (comparing them with particulars, not the whole Body) in it: And therefore I am fully ≈øatisfied, as I ≈øaid before, that the very Fundamental Con≈øtitution may remain, tho the Family ≈øhould be changed by a Competent Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; and that no Injury or Inju≈øtice is done them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, ≈øince their Right was given them only by po≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Laws, and may therefore be taken away again by the ≈øame means: And if ≈øo, after all our Author's ‚òú Labour, the Statute 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. does no ways break in upon our Con≈øtitution. If our Author would but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the words <hi>King de jure,</hi> as I have all through this Paper pre≈øs'd him to do, we ≈øhould ea≈øily rid the Stat. 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. of the Contradiction which he ≈øuppo≈øes <note place="margin">Ca≈øe, <hi>f.</hi> 39</note> it implies.</p>
            <p>A <hi>King de jure</hi> has a Right to ≈øomething, as he ≈øays; that <hi>≈øomething</hi> is the po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Throne, which will con≈øequently draw the Royalties and Revenues of that, with the Allegiance of the Subject. But till he attains that Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, in vertue of which the Right
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:29442:31"/> to tho≈øe Royalties, Allegiance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> belongs to him, he mu≈øt content him≈øelf without them.</p>
            <p>And the ≈øame An≈øwer ≈øerves to his other Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>That this Statute is again≈øt the Law of Nature,</hi> which <note place="margin">Ca≈øe, <hi>f.</hi> 40.</note> our Author from that Huddle of Incon≈øi≈øtencies. <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Ca≈øe, ≈øays, <hi>makes Faith, Obedience, and Lige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, due to the lawful King,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ≈øome parts of 'em indi≈øpen≈øable, and not to be transferred.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It is not worth the while to argue any thing from <hi>Calvin</hi>'s Ca≈øe, the Authority of which can never be of advantage to either ≈øide, becau≈øe there is ≈øcarce any one Propo≈øition (unle≈øs it be the very point ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged) advanced through that whole Ca≈øe, as 'tis reported by my Lord <hi>Coke,</hi> but what may be an≈øwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red (that is, contradicted) by ≈øomething el≈øe of the ≈øame Author in the ≈øame Ca≈øe; but to con≈øider ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to rea≈øon, as much of it as our Author makes u≈øe of. I will not di≈øpute at pre≈øent but that Obedience to Governours is due by the Law of Nature; that is, That the Law of Nature does ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it ≈øelf to Civil Societies when they are fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; and in general obliges ≈øuch as are in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of Subjects, to pay their Governours all that Duty, which, according to the Frame of their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Laws, is nece≈ø≈øary to the Maintenance and Welfare of that Society: Other natural Allegiance there is none; nor does the Law of Nature (tho our Author affirm the contrary, without offering any Proof or Rea≈øon for it) <hi>lay before the Subject any certain Duties which they are to put in practice, whether the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Laws of the Realm enjoyn them or not, and ≈øuch as no human Authority can di≈øpence with, as long as they ≈øtand in the Relation of Prince and Subject.</hi> This is a very wild Notion, and can have no Foundation in Rea≈øon: Take away the Relative Terms of <hi>Prince</hi> and <hi>Subject,</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:29442:31"/> and ≈øuppo≈øe that a Nation ≈øubmits to a particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon after this manner: He ≈øhall have Rule over them, and govern according to ≈øuch particular Rules, as then are, or with their con≈øent afterwards ≈øhall be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed upon, and none other. Is not all the Freedom which they had by Nature, but their being obliged to ≈øubmit to the putting tho≈øe Rules in execution, left with them, and un≈øubmitted; May not any po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitive Law afterwards alter, enlarge, or abridge tho≈øe mea≈øures of Obedience and Submi≈ø≈øion, which were the Creatures of po≈øitive Law at fir≈øt? It may be ≈øaid, it will be incon≈øi≈øtent with the name of <hi>King</hi> to have no Allegiance due to him. I would ask the Objector, Which is more rea≈øonable, that a Notion, the Pedan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try of affirming po≈øitively what the <hi>natural</hi> Sen≈øe of a Term is, ≈øhould have Power over, and render in≈øig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificant, or repeal the plain Words of an expre≈øs Law; or that the Law ≈øhould for once frame a new, tho it may be an improper Sen≈øe, for the Terms, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-rule the Grammarian? If the Law ≈øhould in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs words ≈øay, That he that has a ju≈øt Title to the Crown ≈øhall be ≈øtiled <hi>King de jure</hi> while he is out of Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, (tho that is not ≈øo, nor is that name ever allowed him till he is re≈øtored:) And he that is in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion <hi>King de facto;</hi> that during the time of his Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion a temporary Allegiance ≈øhall be paid by the People to <hi>him,</hi> and not to the King <hi>de jure:</hi> I think common Sen≈øe will ≈øay, that there is no incon≈øi≈øtency in this, unle≈øs the words <hi>King de jure</hi> are ≈øo very Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, that they can't lower their Signification, to a po≈øitive Law, but mu≈øt eternally carry with them one and the ≈øame extent of Power and Exerci≈øe of Authority.</p>
            <pb n="60" facs="tcp:29442:32"/>
            <p> That the Law of Nature obliges a Man to make Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtitution for Injuries done, I agree, but that mu≈øt be out of what is his own, without Injury to another; el≈øe, having robbed one, and having nothing of my own wherewith to make him Reparation; I might rob another to do it: So in the pre≈øent Ca≈øe, If I have been acce≈ø≈øary to the unju≈øt di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing the rightful Prince, nature obliges me to make him what recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence I ju≈øtly may: But if it fall out, that nature does not at all intermeddle with determining what particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Per≈øons have a Right to the Government, <hi>Or make one Man King, the re≈øt his Subjects,</hi> but that the <note place="margin">Ca≈øe f. 40.</note> Relation between the Per≈øons governing, and to be governed, and the mea≈øures of Protection and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience thence flowing, are of po≈øitive In≈øtitution, and the Effect of the particular Laws of the Land: And if the Laws of the Land have ≈øo fixt the Duty of my Allegiance to the King in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, that, acting in the condition of a private Subject, I can't withdraw it from him, without a breach of tho≈øe Laws, without taking from him what the Law has given him a Right unto: The Law of Nature can't oblige me to that; nor has the di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed Prince any Right by the Law of Nature to claim or exact that ≈øatisfaction from me; ≈øo that the Statute 11 <hi>H.</hi> 7. does not at all thwart or contradict the Law of Nature, or any Duty in di≈øpen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly incumbent on the Subject by it.</p>
            <p>This Con≈øideration will indeed aggravate the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ju≈øtice of my contributing towards ≈øuch an U≈øurpati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and make People that have any ≈øen≈øe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, very cautious how they venture upon doing a thing of that kind; where the very Act of doing the thing, puts it out of their Power to wipe out any part of their former Sin, by an endeavour to make Reparation, without their contracting a new Guilt.</p>
            <pb n="61" facs="tcp:29442:32"/>
            <p> Our Author compares the ca≈øe of Obedience due <note place="margin">Ca≈øe <hi>f,</hi> 23.</note> to the King, with the Ca≈øe of the Subject, as to the Protection which the King is obliged to give him: The≈øe, I agree, are very fitly con≈øidered together, as mutually explaining and proving one the other. Let us ≈øee whether the rea≈øon of that Ca≈øe will not fully come up to the proof of what I am endeavouring to make out.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>The King is obliged to maintain his Subjects in their Rights and Properties not only while they are in po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, but al≈øo, when another has di≈ø≈øeized them by fraud or vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence:</hi> True, he is to do the latter (which carries a re≈øemblance to the ca≈øe in que≈øtion) as well as the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer: But it mu≈øt be, according to the mea≈øures, and pur≈øuing the methods the Law pre≈øcribes. Where a ≈øubject is di≈ø≈øeized, Law is to precede force: There mu≈øt be a deci≈øion by a proper Judge in his favour, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there be a re≈øtoring him to his po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion: Till that be done, he is to quiet and defend the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øour in the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, tho' gotten by fraud and inju≈øtice: The King him≈øelf, to who≈øe Wi≈ødom and Authority the Con≈øtitution has entru≈øted ≈øo much, cannot by virtue of all that Power doe the greate≈øt or lea≈øt of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects that Right, which, he in his private Capacity un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly knows belongs, and that the Law ought to adjudge to him; and ≈øhall we then ≈øay, that, in the Kings ca≈øe, a private Man, to whom the Law has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven no manner of Authority to judge of any ones Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ≈øhall take upon him, by force, to attempt the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øetling a King, who is quietly Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becau≈øe <hi>he thinks</hi> another man has a better right? Is it not more agreeable to the Compari≈øon our Author has made, and to the Rea≈øon of Mankind, That where there is a National Submi≈ø≈øion, in a Parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary way, to the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øour of the Throne, Every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tender
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:29442:33"/> to impeach that Settlement, ought to wait for a Declaration of his Right by the States of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, till which is done, Particular Subjects, ought, with regard to common Safety and Peace, to acquie≈øce under the Power from which they receive Protection, and to which, by their Repre≈øentatives, they have <hi>Submitted.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I own there may fall out very hard ca≈øes ≈øometimes, upon the≈øe grounds, and ≈øuch Objections as will not receive an ea≈øie An≈øwer: But I am ≈øure it will be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ea≈øie to maintain, That the mi≈øchiefs will be <hi>le≈øs</hi> in them≈øelves, and likely to fall out <hi>≈øeldomer,</hi> than by allowing every Subject a Liberty to embroil the State, upon a pretence that the Government is not in the hands it ought to be.</p>
            <p>In matters of this kind in a <hi>mixt</hi> Monarchy, there will be ≈øome difficulties in the <hi>Theory,</hi> that are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an≈øwerable. The notion of a mixt monarchy it ≈øelf, will not bear a ≈øtrict di≈øqui≈øition: For, granting that of nece≈ø≈øity there mu≈øt in all Governments be ≈øome la≈øt re≈øort for the final determination of all differences (which will ≈øeem a very rea≈øonable propo≈øition) any Man may immediately run it up to a <hi>Tyranny</hi> or <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular Government.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the la≈øt re≈øort and final determination of Right or Wrong between the King and People, ≈øhould be agreed to be in the King; notwith≈øtanding all the Laws now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted, he may when he plea≈øes (in <hi>Theory)</hi> make his Will the ≈øole Law: For whenever he is minded to attempt it, after the matter's running through other hands, it comes at la≈øt to him to give the Rule, which is the gaining of his point. So on the other ≈øide, if the People are the ultimate Re≈øort, and ≈øole Judges of the Rights of their Prince, of nece≈ø≈øity their deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations mu≈øt be obeyed, tho' they determine again≈øt
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:29442:33"/> his true Right. And that will in con≈øequence prove the Government no Monarchy, tho' he be in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and carry the name of King, there being a Power ≈øuperiour to him, and to which he is accountable for his Actions. If both Prince and People are to join in it, and they differ in their Sentiments, there is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination, and con≈øequently uncertainty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øion.</p>
            <p>This is the natural con≈øequence of driving up the≈øe notions to their heighth: But this is not therefore e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very day the ca≈øe: There is a good old ≈øaying, that will interpo≈øe to ≈øave us: <hi>Ip≈øae res nolunt mal√® ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øtrari.</hi> This will, notwith≈øtanding all tho≈øe fine no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, keep both the Parties from attempting <hi>≈øucce≈øs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully</hi> any thing extravagant, and utterly incon≈øi≈øtent with that mixture of Power, by which we are ruled, ≈øo much to our ea≈øe and advantage, tho' that mixture of Power can't be maintained in ≈øtrict rea≈øoning. I ≈øay all this to this purpo≈øe: I find it is ≈øtrongly object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to what I have advanced <hi>(viz.</hi> That a private Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject after a ≈øolemn ≈øubmi≈ø≈øion of the Kingdom to an U≈øurper in Title, ought not to attempt the re≈øtoring the <hi>King de jure,</hi> till there be ≈øome ≈øolemn deci≈øion in his favour, the Power of which I have placed in the States of the Kingdom) That this way of applying to the Parliament for Ju≈øtice, and making their Claim there, may be prevented by the U≈øurper's not admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the States of the Kingdom to meet, or receive ≈øuch Claim, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If I ≈øhould grant that they have no Power of meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to that purpo≈øe, without the con≈øent of the U≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per (which I do not;) and ≈øo, that this is a defect in our Laws, and one of the ca≈øes again≈øt which a certain Remedy is unavoidably wanting in a mixt Monarchy; yet I may venture to ≈øay, That if the right of the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:29442:34"/> Prince be apparent, all the Attempts of the U≈øurper to ≈øuppre≈øs it, will at long run prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øucce≈øsful. We ≈øee the Parliament of <hi>H.</hi> 6. and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of 1660. did find Opportunities of doing right to the injured Prince; and without them the People, whether they <hi>ought</hi> or no, is one ca≈øe; but I think I may venture to ≈øay they <hi>will</hi> not long bear it.</p>
            <p>If U≈øurpations do put us under the≈øe great Difficulties, the natural Influence that the Con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of that will have, is, that the Nation will ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit unto and ≈øuffer but very few of them; and 'tis a very unlikely thing, that the Rightful Prince ≈øhould be turned out without great Mi≈øadmini≈øtrations. But after all, I think no one need be a≈øhamed of owning it to be his Opinion, That if it ≈øhould unhappily fall out to be the Ca≈øe, that one of that Family to whom the Crown was at fir≈øt limited, ≈øhould be injuriou≈øly di≈øpo≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of that Crown; and the re≈øtoring him to it, could be compa≈ø≈øed by no means, but ≈øuch as would lay a Foundation for daily Di≈øturbances and Civil Wars in future Reigns, that that Per≈øon's Right which was given him by the Laws, ought not to be ≈øet in Competition with the Laws them≈øelves, and the Peace and Quiet of the whole Body of the People.</p>
            <p>The Con≈øequences which our Author draws from his Suppo≈øition, that <hi>Cromwell</hi> had been made King (which I confe≈øs would have been very mi≈øchievous and intolerable) move me not at all. In the fir≈øt place; notwith≈øtanding what he affirms, <hi>That it was almo≈øt come to a Conclu≈øion that he ≈øhould take that Title upon him.</hi> I can't grant that there was any likelihood of his being a King in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion, entitled to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and benefit of this Law. Perhaps he might have made an Intere≈øt in ≈øome of the Army (though
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:29442:34"/> mo≈øt People believe the fear of their falling off from him, kept him from it) to have proclaimed him; and in the Hou≈øe of Commons, or Parliament as they called them≈øelves, to have ≈øubmitted to him. But I have before ≈øaid, a bare proclaiming one <hi>King</hi> won't do the bu≈øine≈øs, for then we may have as many Kings <hi>de facto</hi> as there are Rabbles of People in the Nation: But to make one who had no vi≈øible Right before, ≈øuch a King <hi>de facto</hi> as may claim a Temporary Allegiance from the People, he mu≈øt have not only the Power of the Nation in his Hands, and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini≈øtration of Ju≈øtice in his Name; but (what <hi>Crom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well,</hi> as he had been forced to manage matters for the getting him≈øelf into that mon≈øtrous lawle≈øs Power he enjoyed, could never have obtained,) the Submi≈ø≈øion of the <hi>remaining parts of the Con≈øtitution,</hi> the Lords and Commons, to him as their King and Governour. Till that is done, I know no Obligation any private man is under of paying Allegiance to ≈øuch a King, never having by him≈øelf or his Repre≈øentatives, ≈øubmitted to him. As on the other ≈øide, when that is done, and I receive the benefit of Protection from him, till his Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion which protects me is lo≈øt; or the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion which was made for me revoked and undone by an equal Power: I know nothing that can ju≈øtifie my thinking my ≈øelf wi≈øer and more knowing than my own and the whole Peoples Repre≈øentatives; and from ≈øuch an overweening Opinion of my ≈øelf, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring the Di≈øturbance or Subver≈øion of a Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment well and fully ≈øetled.</p>
            <p>But why in the ≈øecond place ≈øhould ≈øuch Suppo≈øitions of what <hi>may</hi> be, be u≈øed as Arguments: May we not from the Ob≈øervation, That no in≈øtance like that did ever yet happen to ≈øet Con≈øcience ≈øo upon the Rack,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:29442:35"/> rea≈øonably attribute ≈øome ≈øhare in the Guidance of tho≈øe Affairs to the Providence of a good God, who hitherto has; and, as we have rea≈øon from that Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to hope, (unle≈øs by our Unthankfulne≈øs we draw the contrary on our ≈øelves) will ≈øtill continue to deliver us from ≈øuch Difficulties and Snares.</p>
            <p>If all tho≈øe Advantages which our Author reckons up, would have follow'd his obtaining the Crown, and if it was in his Power to have taken it when he had pleas'd, Does not the neglecting tho≈øe Advantages ≈øeem to proceed from an <hi>Infatuation,</hi> as if Providence had determined again≈øt him? And ought not that ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ≈øtrike an Awe and Reverence on the Minds of all People towards their pre≈øent Maje≈øties Per≈øons and Government; every ≈øtep of who≈øe Undertaking and Progre≈øs till their Advancement to the Throne, ≈øeems to be a Series of Providences; and the Effects of who≈øe Government are ≈øuch, as a Man need not ≈øtand in fear of being taxed with Impiety, if he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute the Cau≈øe of them immediately to God's own Hand.</p>
            <p>Before our Author comes to An≈øwer Objections, (which I'll not meddle with, but leave them to ≈øhift for them≈øelves) he produces Two Arguments to prove his A≈ø≈øertion, and it would be unju≈øt not to take notice <note place="margin">Ca≈øe, <hi>f.</hi> 48.</note> of them. The fir≈øt I have granted already, and it makes nothing again≈øt me. The ≈øecond I will but ju≈øt mention, and leave the Reader to make his own Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervations upon it. 'Tis the difficulty of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <note place="margin">Ca≈øe <hi>f.</hi> 53.</note> who is a <hi>King in Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion:</hi> It were a great hard≈øhip to put the determining that upon the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ordinary Subjects, Per≈øons of mean Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding; and therefore for <hi>that</hi> Rea≈øon their Allegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance ≈øhall not be due there; but 'tis nothing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:29442:35"/> it of the ≈øame Per≈øons, that they be perfect Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øters of our Fundamental Con≈øtitution, and the Pedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of the Royal Family, that they know <hi>Who it is</hi>

            <p>This, Sir, I think ≈øufficient to be ≈øaid to what is ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from the Laws of the Land in the <hi>Ca≈øe</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence,</hi> as far as they concern the Po≈øition I undertook to maintain. Perhaps the Reader may think I have copied the Author's Pattern, in offering things which ≈øeem to prove more than the Que≈øtion, according to the ≈øtrictne≈øs with which I have ≈øtated it, required: I am not ≈øen≈øible that I have omitted the taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of any one Argument that is materially offered from the Laws, in conttradiction to my point; I am ≈øure if I have, it was pa≈øt over for want of taking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, not by de≈øign, as what I thought could not receive an An≈øwer.</p>
            <p>But, Sir, when I have ≈øaid this, I mu≈øt be≈øpeak all the favourable Allowances your good Nature can give, to what I have written, <hi>to</hi> the ill handling a good Cau≈øe, that would have born a much better Defence in the ≈øub≈øtantial Parts of it; and more, <hi>to</hi> the Faults that I have been guilty of in the manner of it: An ordinary Reader would hardly pardon the latter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe he will think a little care might have avoided them; and I am ≈øen≈øible how guilty I am of the wor≈øt of that kind, abundance of Repetitions; which mu≈øt be tedious and unea≈øie. All the excu≈øe that I can offer for my ≈øelf is, that the manner of writing in the way of Reflexion, (which obliges me often to take notice of the ≈øame Arguments u≈øed to different purpo≈øes) and not as an entire Di≈øcour≈øe, has made
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:29442:36"/> that unavoidable. And, Sir, <hi>you</hi> know I have not had time enough allowed me to make it ≈øhort: Who≈øe Fault that is <hi>You</hi> can be≈øt tell: And therefore, whatever others do, you in Ju≈øtice mu≈øt excu≈øe,</p>
